She&#8217;d thought of dumping him at his father&#8217;s house, but his dad is a complete dick and Rusty, who helped Finn restore the Impala, which now belongs to her, could be helpful in the event of car troubles.I&#8217;m not going to go into great detail about the things that happened during their trip to California, but, as expected, Honor and Rusty don&#8217;t immediately hit it off since Rusty and Finn stopped being friends after Finn enlisted and he started acting like he hated Honor. The story mostly revolves around these two, but there are secondary characters we meet along the way, some who were in it very briefly (Wyatt surprised me in a good way), while others were in it a bit longer, but I thought they added to the story and gave us some insight into both Honor and Rusty.Even though Honor and Rusty already knew each other, &lt;i>In Honor&lt;/i> kind of reminded me of &lt;i>The Statistical Probability of Falling in Love&lt;/i>, though it was more serious and sad at times, especially when Honor was remembering Finn. This happened quite a bit throughout the book and I thought, like I said, it was sad, it was also very realistic. I did like the book, but there were a few problems I had that kept it from being one that I might&#8217;ve loved.First, Honor never returned Gina&#8217;s calls. After what happened with Finn, I would think that Gina would&#8217;ve been running to the police and some kind of alert would&#8217;ve been put out for the car, and it was mean of Honor to cause Gina and, I&#8217;m sure Honor&#8217;s best friend, to worry. Second, I was having to really suspend disbelief about a scene at the beach, which had a major impact on what happened with Honor&#8217;s plans. I also felt they got out of the resulting problems way too easily. And don&#8217;t get me started on the way Honor acted there. Up until that point I liked her, but I thought she acted like an immature ass, especially when she just wandered around moping about what she was going to do without trying to help Rusty (and she should&#8217;ve fessed up from the get-go). I just felt that the end was too rushed and should&#8217;ve had another chapter or two (it&#8217;s only 235 pages, as is). Finally, while we do find out why Finn enlisted and what made Rusty go to his funeral, we never found out *****spoiler*****  when or why Rusty and Finn ended up getting back in touch with each other, which I thought was a big omission. I also wondered why Gina couldn&#8217;t have helped with school and why they didn&#8217;t look into loans or scholarships*****end spoiler*****.Some of the things that led to what happened could&#8217;ve been explained, which would&#8217;ve made the book stronger. I also expected, and would&#8217;ve liked, a bit more romance (not hot sex scenes) in this book. I think I was disappointed with the lack of it because I was expecting more going into it, for some reason.Having said that, I did like &lt;i>In Honor&lt;/i> and Kirby did a good job making me feel what Honor was going through, how close she&#8217;d been to her brother and why they&#8217;d have done anything for each other. I thought the end, part of which some might see as a little too coincidental, was really cute and I was satisfied with it. Even with the problems I had with this book, I would recommend it, it was a fast easy read, I liked Kirby&#8217;s writing style and, while it wasn&#8217;t a light, happy book, I thought the storyline was original and different than most contemporary books I&#8217;ve read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Good, but had a few problems.", "unixReviewTime": 1390176000, "reviewTime": "01 20, 2014"}

I am still a print guy, so for me The Vault of Walt was pretty much all new material.  And there were some essays that I still often reflect on when mulling Disney history.  But with the original printing now out of print and the cheapest copies at the time of this posting starting in the mid $50 range, I just cannot recommend that edition.  Now fortunately it does appear that the price has been dropping thanks to the printing of The Revised Vault of Walt.  But the revised edition did not collect all of the original material.  Could a second volume of this series make all of the original content available at an affordable price?The Vault of Walt Volume 2: More Unofficial, Unauthorized, Uncensored Disney Stories Never Told by Jim Korkis continues in collecting his essays on Disney history.  Like the earlier versions this book is broken into four sections; Walt Disney Stories, Disney Film Stories, Disney Park Stories, and Other Disney Stories.  The essays are not connected and can be read out of order.  Essays printed before include: &#34;Santa Walt&#34;, &#34;Blackbeard's Ghost&#34;, &#34;Captain Eo&#34;, and &#34;Golden Oak Ranch&#34;.  New stories range from &#34;Walt and NASA&#34;, &#34;Secrets of the Santa Cartoons&#34;, &#34;The Birth of the Disneyland Jungle Cruise&#34;, and &#34;The Seven Snow Whites&#34; which show the diversity of the included essays.The Vault of Walt Volume 2 contains 15 new essays.  And honestly some of these essays caught my interest just with their titles matching some of my own personal interests.  I am a huge fan of Roy O. Disney so I enjoyed diving into &#34;Roy O. Disney: The Forgotten Brother Who Built the Magic Kingdom&#34; which does a great job of showing the elder brother's role in getting the Florida resort built.  And &#34;Walt's Chicago&#34; provides background to Walt Disney's relationship with his birthplace.  And of course in the wake of Saving Mr. Banks the essay &#34;Mary Poppins: Walt Disney and P.L. Travers&#34; delves into the story of Disney courting Travers and her opinion of the finished Mary Poppins.The stories themselves are generally short and clear.  They are easy to read and in many cases discuss a piece of Disney history not normally touched on.  It would be an easy book to enjoy on a number of train rides where you stop and start the text over and over again (which may be the way I read this volume).  The majority do read like detailed blogs, and those who have read them before may want more new content.  But I am someone who has only read these tales in the print format.  Yes, in the electronic age I was first exposed to these in a physical form.Let's look at the tale of the tape though.  There are two essays in the original volumes that I cannot find reprinted in The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2.  The  first essay, &#34;Song of the South Premiere&#34; has likely not been reproduced since Korkis now has in print Who's Afraid of the Song of the South which includes a chapter on the premiere.  The second essay, &#34;Mickey Mouse Theater of the Air&#34;, is a highly interesting essay on Mickey Mouse in the era of old time radio.  So for half the price of the original volume, you can buy The Revised Vault of Walt and The Vault of Walt Volume 2 and lose one essay with the trade off of 20 new ones.  Or one can buy the two Kindle versions for a fifth of the original's current used price.  So I think it is obvious the Between Books recommendation is to buy the two books instead of tracking down a used copy of the original.Fans of Jim Korkis will want The Vault of Walt Volume 2 in their collection.  Serious Disney fans will want this volume for the unique content found in its pages.  And those more casual Disney fans can find plenty of enjoyment within.  And best of all, nearly all of the originally printed essays can be purchased for a reasonable price!Review Copy Provided by Theme Park Press", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "The Vault of Walt Volume 2", "unixReviewTime": 1394409600, "reviewTime": "03 10, 2014"}

I was actually pretty surprised at how much I liked the plot of Maiden Flight. A lot of the story was world building, character introduction, and crazy hot m/f/m sexytimes. This is my first m&eacute;nage a trios read so it&#8217;s exciting to get something new under the reading belt. Being a short kindle freebie I was pretty satisfied overall. I&#8217;ve read some reviews that mention how similar this is to Anne McCaffrey&#8217;s Dragonriders of Pern series and I can&#8217;t comment on that because I haven&#8217;t had the chance to start her books yet. I can do some similarities between authors and the worlds they create but I really don&#8217;t like copycats, just saying. I hope I don&#8217;t find out in the future that it was a little too alike for my tastes&#8230;The storyline concept was actually really interesting if not a little over-the-top. The dragons are intelligent, fierce, and very loyal warriors. They are matched with a human knight that they can telepathically communicate with. But the bond doesn&#8217;t stop there &#8211; the dragons are unable to mate until their knight counterparts find their mate first. Why, might you ask? Well knight and dragon have such a unique bond that they can actually feel what the other feels. So in other words the dragon sex drive is so strong that it would drive their knight insane if they had no mate to run to. This exceptional fact made all the sex scenes pretty fascinating. If there was human sex, there was sure to be dragon sex involved as well, and vice versa. This I could handle. The insta-love on the other hand I had an issue with.I mentioned in a previous review that I used to absolutely adore the idea of love at first sight. It&#8217;s such a dreamy and romantic idea that I still sometimes like to daydream about it. But reality and reading well-paced romantically involved books has shifted my judgment. I find myself actually cringing and rolling my eyes pretty far in the back of my head when insta-love hits a heroine and/or hero. Sadly in Maiden Flight&#8217;s case the couple (and the third-wheel!) gets hit pretty hard. Now of course once I got my eyes to focus in their proper position I just accepted the fact that it was part of the story. After that I could enjoy most of what was going on.  I actually enjoyed the romantic situation between the heroine&#8217;s mother and her perspective beau. It was slower-paced and much more realistic.Although there wasn&#8217;t much of a plot to be found I still enjoyed the book. I liked Maiden Flight so much that I went ahead and bought the next couple of books to see how the story progresses. I am hoping the sex scenes become a little bit more creative and the characters get more fleshed out. I&#8217;m hoping for more of the plot to come to the forefront about the war going on, the politics within the Lair, and I&#8217;d like to see more interaction between the characters. I like me some sex but I also like some dialogue, some intrigue, something, anything really.

Once I started I could not put it down.  You have an awesome plot that just keeps twisting, a nice OH WOW totally didn't see that coming moment. Megan's husband is an abusive man, and Megan is trying to forget him. Along the way she meets Dr. Adrian who she starts dating, but it seems as soon as they start weird things happen. She thinks her ex-husband is back and is going to make her life a living hell, along with Adrian's.Conrad is not a normal person he seems to have some suped up abilities which come in handy for him to find his ex-wife and her lover.I really enjoyed the background of the story being insanity? Can you prove someone is legally insane? That is hard to do. But within this book it makes you think about it.The characters were nice. The problem I had with this book is the fact it seemed the two main character Megan and Adrian didn't date quite enough before they &#34;jumped&#34; into the relationship. Megan wanted to wait a while before Adrian came into her child's life which I think is just great for a mom to do. But it seemed it happened quicker within the story. It was like bam they meet, then they go on a date, then lets wait before you meet my daughter, then okay you can meet her. I felt as though they didn't develop enough of a relationship within the story. It was hard to feel their feelings for each other, it just didn't feel real.Also some scenes seemed a bit rushed. Like the author was trying to get back to the main part of the story so he wanted to rush with the details. I think maybe if he slowed down a bit and added more details then it would have worked.If you like thrillers, I would for sure give this book a read.

In this romantic mystery, Sebastian Alder survived Waterloo, barely. As he recovers, a woman appears to inform him that now, he is Lord Somerton. Removed to better chambers and an increased hope of actual recovery, he finds the legacy a great deal more trouble than it seemed to be worth.\"The Somerton inheritance was a tainted privilege. In some ways he was no better off than he would have been if he had remained a penniless officer of the line on half pay. At least then he only had his siblings and himself to worry about. Now he had a household and an estate, all claiming pennies from a purse that looked decidedly the worse for wear.... Where had it all gone and how, in God's name, was he expected to restore the family fortunes?He had thought the matter through in the tedious hours in the coach and decided that if he thought of the task ahead as being akin to a sudden promotion to Colonel of a regiment, it did not seem so daunting.\"Sebastian meets the new family, assumes his new responsibility and intends to make provisions for his brother and sister. As soon as he untangles the financial mess Anthony Kingsley left behind. There are hanger's on, wise granny, an aunt and dozens of cousins, plus tenants, retainers and servants to assess and get to know. Always near by, ready to offer assistance or subtle guidance, is Isabel. He sees her wounds, the grief she struggles beneath and that she is trying to reach beyond the sorrows and anger. Through Sebastian's eyes we observe Isabel's healing steps, stumbles and set backs. It was an interesting perspective because generally the socks are on the other foot.This story is slightly Gothic in tone, the writing smooth and gently reflective. There was an old-fashioned pace I really enjoyed. There was no rush of the romance, the story or the ending. The dialog kept you in the period without effort or cliches. Characters were believable, though slowly revealed. Personally I like that but others may find the bits and pieces revelation too old skool. Secondary characters weren't two dimensional though the villains were both over the top once their disguises were stripped away. I was disappointed by the second villain's big reveal. For all the realism it brought to the story, I felt manipulated and a wee bit resentful.I liked Sebastian, his siblings and Isabel. I appreciated how the tragic past was handled as part of the story, not a cudgel to wallow in and create more angst. They were the Ordinary Folks we all think we are until trials come our way and we learn not only is there more to us, but less as well. Confronting their own failings, they have compassion for other's. Mostly, it was absolutely wonderful to read an Awakening Story that wasn't all about the sexual attraction or trumped up conflicts that reduce hero and heroine to argumentative banter based on misunderstandings. They were cautious with each other, kind to themselves even. Taking time, giving support and space as needed, Sebastian and Isabel's story advanced even as the mysteries, debts and confusions mounted to a larger pile.I had a bit of difficulty with the last couple chapters of this book. It tied up \"too neatly\" for me. I like a bit of conflict left hanging, things to work through together in happily ever after land. In fairness, the financial situation is probably Huge Enough, not to mention the \"secret\" Sebastian has chosen to keep. I believe that will come back to bite them both in the end. Of course, it could simply be the fact I seldom like epilogues and this one was a bit too sweet for me. That said, I did enjoy 98.7% of the book, the writing style, characterizations, and well-handles story line. Definitely will look for other works by this author. I recommend Lord Somerton's Heir for when you're in a Traditional mood, looking for a meatier story with a gentle romance.~Note I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit that I haven't followed the Fantastic Four very closely for the past few years. I know that Jonathan Hickman made quite a few changes to the general cast of characters when he was writing the book, but I had no idea the book was largely dominated by children, now. And where are the original cast members? What is going on? Sure, I like She-Hulk, but not really in a team book. And the rest of these characters are D-listers, as best. I certainly don't pick up a book like Fantastic Four to read about adventures of children and their reading-glasses-wearing purple dragon nanny. Why are there mole men in the Baxter building? Why is one of them a decapitated head? Why is one a cross-dresser? Aren't mole men asexually grown clones to begin with? And who is this old Johnny Storm character with the burned face and gaping eye socket where his eye should be? Not only was I completely lost while reading this, the stories were not engaging and even off-putting. The book is full of character I know little about, care even less about, and it's illustrated by one of my least-favorite illustrators - Mike Allred. All-in-all, I really couldn't find a single thing I enjoyed about this book. I really couldn't even make it through to the end. I made it about 75%of the way through the book, but even that was a chore.

I loved each story.Zero by Rene Folsom ~ Great read that really has me hoping that Rene will continue with this story, maybe like her Soul Seers series.  I will resort to begging her for more.  I absolutely NEED to kno if it was Mason with CJ at the end or if it was someone else!Isaac by Michael Loring ~ Interesting take on andrioids that are extremely human like.  They are companion androids.  They help with housework and keep their human company and help take care of them.  They have human functions and can eat and actually think for themselves.  They have their own personalities as well.  They also have feelings.World Gone Wrong by Bart Hopkins ~ What happens when you wake up one day and the internet is completely gone?  Well, that happened to Simeon, Karina, and Messler.  The Government has shut it down to make Earth better.  People depend on it way too much and they don't think for themselves anymore, just google whatever they need.  They find out there is an Earth 2 and there will be a lottery to go there.  Really want to know if Karina waited or not.Life Companion by ML Ryan ~ This is a story about what happens when people decide to &#34;create&#34; others to match what they want in a companion/spouse.  I loved how this story showed how much you loose by creating your perfect match.  Very interesting and an enjoyable read.Born Ready by Katheryn Van Pelt ~ Very interesting read.  I do want to know the rest of Alex's story, after she escapes again.Show Me by Magen McMinimy ~ Yet another story by Magen that has completely sucked me in and left me wanting more.  Was a great read.  It was interesting how the aliens are shape shifters and what they truly look like.New Eden by Eaton Thomas Palmer ~ Another interesting read of a mated pair, or their bond/love.  Just how far will it reach through the galaxies and what lengths you will go to for the one you love.  I really liked it.Love Forgotten by Stephanie Summers ~  This is a great read about having, and using, way too much technology.  When you become so dependent on it, and have artificial inteligence do everything for you, you miss out on so much.What Happens on Destiny 2 by Tara Moeller ~  Great read.  I love how both the main characters got a very big surprise by seeing each other.

Conroe is a political story told from a unique prospective.  The author takes us back to the years of President Nixon, Watergate, and various other plots that occurred out of the public eye.  Some of the characters are fictional, but the events are a part of history.  Mark David Chapman, Arthur Bremer, James Earl Ray, Sirhan Sirhan are some familiar names.  What is not known is what, or rather who, was really responsible for their actions.Michele Clark is a reporter determined to expose government corruption.  The story is told from a narrator&#8217;s point of view; although it takes a while to realize the identity of the person.  Corruption travels to the very top government level with twists and turns in between.  Michele risks her life to uncover a secret operation that revolves around assassins and every time she gets close, she is shut down.  Follow Michelle as she goes above and beyond reporting and begins to investigate areas that are better left alone.  Samantha is a pretty blond, Artie is an innocent pawn, and Dennis seems to have it all.  What is the connection between these three and how do they relate to small spiders?The plot unfolds slowly and surprisingly.  Artie finds himself manipulated to do things and he is totally unaware of his own actions.  Dennis tries to help but they both underestimate Samantha&#8217;s power.  We get a glimpse of the real possibilities behind Watergate, the Kennedy assassinations, murders, and cover-ups.  Michele Clark wanted to tell the truth to the American public about the real dealings behind the scenes and remains determined despite threats to her life.  Everybody seems to have secret connections and there may or may not be any good guys.This is a good look into secret organizations and political corruption designed to give the powerful the desires of their heart.  The average citizen has no idea about the inner workings of political organizations and after reading this book I know that people, situations and even the news are often manipulated to obtain desired results.  I look at politics so differently and I see how easy it is to misplace trust.  I believe that anyone with an interest in politics and history should read this book.

Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I totally did not expect this book, &#34;Water's Edge&#34; by Robert Whitlow, to live up to that sort of expectation. But it did.Part of the reason was I started the book while still living overseas. Then life in W. Africa happened: a war next door started, internet died, hot season and tons of power outages exhausted, a kid graduated, we moved internationally, I dove back into that phenomenon of worse culture shock coming home than going there...So I started the book, stopped when life happened - and couldn't get back into it because I couldn't find where I'd left off and was having a hard time wading through the vague familiarity of having already read the first several chapters. It finally took knowing that my review deadline date (or else I'd lose my status as a book reviewer) was rapidly approaching to motivate me to just sit down and read the book.I'm so glad I did... and thinking I'm gonna go find another one of his action/suspense legal dramas and check it out. I thoroughly enjoyed this read.Tom Crane, an up and coming lawyer living the good life in the big city loses his dad, his job and his girl in relatively quick succession. Then, while back in the small town where he grew up attempting to close up and tie up all the loose ends from his father's law practice, he runs into curious circumstances: a mysterious trust fund without clear documentation, unexplained details concerning his father's accidental drowning while out fishing with a friend, an unexpected friend in the daughter of that other man who also died in the accident, an eccentric spiritual warrior uncle, uncomfortable situations with trusted and long time family friends... and last but not least, an unforeseen and lifechangingly powerful intimate encounter with God.Tom Crane thinks he gets it all figured out and is ready to move on, ready for the next step accepting a great job offer from another big law firm in the big city. I was all set for the &#34;drama&#34; to predictably settle and for the last bit of the book to turn into a sappy Christian romance...We were both surprised and survived!

HATHAWAY \"mima785\"", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "When I was seeking more information about how to grow in my Christian life over 30 years ago, one of the first reference books that was recommended was Unger's &#34;The New Unger's Bible Dictionary&#34;. It was/is an excellent resource for understanding the tenets and history of the Bible. So when I saw this book, also by Dr. Unger, as a Kindle freeby one day I jumped on it. It is well worth the cost of buying it if you missed the free offer.Dr. Unger wrote this material in 1945 as a dissertation and partial requirement for the degree of Doctor of Theology. Even though we don't think of 1945 as being &#34;modern&#34; the ways of Satan to confuse, trap, and derail the Christian life are as old as humanity and what was true then is true now. I'm very grateful for the Kindle built in dictionary because I had to use it frequently to get the whole meaning of what was being said. The language is very intellectual but I don't even have a college degree and I can understand what he is saying.It helps to have a good background in the Bible because many scripture references are used. Also, Dr. Unger tells it like it is--no politically correct allowances are given for questionable activities. He explains how the workers of Satan use divination, astrology, mediumship, speaking to the dead, and all other forms of occult practices to lead people into sin and away from the truth of God's authority.The first few chapters are a little dry and seem to be the most outdated, expecially since we don't often refer to people of other religions as &#34;heathens&#34; any more. But that was common to the time of the writing and the truths have not changed, just the words we use to describe them. By the time the author gets to chapters 6 and beyond it starts to get really interesting. Have you ever wondered how magic could be sinful? After all, pulling a scarf out of a sleve seems pretty innocent. Well, the author explains what about magic is sinful and why. I love the TV shows about people that talk to the dead and give assurance to loved ones that all is well &#34;on the other side&#34;. Well, that is called necromancy and Dr. Unger explains why that is deceitful as well. What about reading the future from looking at a dead animals liver? That is called augury and it is still done in parts of the world. Did you know one way of telling the future was performed by people who slept in empty graves to get messages from their ancestors? Me neither! I have heard of people sitting under pyramids to channel &#34;energy&#34;. I wonder if that would qualify as something similar?We live in such a babylonian society and so much of what we commonly see is linked to superstition and demonology it is frightening. Do you wear a lucky medallion around your neck? In a series of fun books I just finished and gave 5 star reviews to, the main character wears an &#34;eye of Horas&#34; charm on a chain around her neck and rubs it when she gets frightened. Totems like that are a form of animism (look that up in your dictionary).The truth of God is so simple but we always want more; more knowledge, more power. God wants to be the source of our strength and will not stand for letting us be lead into the errors of temptation. But that will not stop Satan from trying. Dr, Unger says periods of demon activity come and go just like Christain religious revivals. I think we are in a period of increased demon activity and we need to know how to recognise it so we won't be lead astray.

Each entry contains 1 or more species but notnecessarily all of the species within that genus.  Photosfrequently include the plant in various stages of theplant's life, or closeups of plant parts.

Sansom does with Dominion - presenting an alternative history in which Winston Churchill does not become Prime Minister of Britain in 1940 and the men who do come to power agree to an appeasement with Germany that finds the now authoritarian government of Britain heavily influenced by their new Fascist friends - is simply fascinating! I love the idea of exploring how every little alteration and change of events can so heavily impact every aspect of our world. And the changes here make for some devastating and far reaching consequences.I have to admit that I got bogged down at times with the various political and social factions discussed and had a hard time keeping them straight (Socialism, Communism, Fascism, Nationalism, Imperialism....just so many &#34;ism's&#34;!). There is so much intricate history here as well - the various countries involved with this ongoing war for German domination, their various leaders and the shifting allegiances between countries, the scientific advancement during this time - that I found myself having to stop reading the book to go look up the many bits and pieces of factual history in order to be able to determine the changes taking places in this alternative world. This slowed down my reading somewhat and caused some confusion but the historical notes at the end of the novel did help alleviate some of that confusion.For me the driving force and what kept bringing be back into the story was the human element. Taking these broad and perplexing ideals and showing how they affected and influenced the people having to live under them made this shifted history seem real and frightening. It was sad yet inspiring to see the many reasons these characters joined Churchill's Resistance and was awe-inspiring to witness the bravery and selflessness they presented. On the flip side it was horrifying to see the greed, prejudice and cruelty of some of the other characters. All of these people came to life for me and thoroughly captured my attention.In particular the two characters that fascinated me the most were Frank Muncaster and Gunther Hoth. Both are such complex, well developed characters that kept surprising me with their growth throughout the story. Frank, the scientist holding a dangerous and deadly secret, is such a sad, scared, introverted character that spent his life being bullied and unloved by everyone but who proved to have more bravery than most could imagine when it mattered. Most surprising of all, I found myself remarkably feeling compassion for Gunther Hoth, a Nazi man through and through, who had lost so much throughout his life but carried on with a purpose and determination to do what he felt was his job and his duty to Germany. He is a monster for what he did and what he supported but one that had a heart, although a twisted and misjudging one in my opinion. I am always delighted to find a novel that makes me feel for characters that are so multidimensional.All in all Dominion is a thought provoking and complex look at how our world and its history can change on a dime based on the wills, egos, and actions of others and how the actions of the few can so alter the lives of the many. This is my first novel by C.J. Sansom but it will definitely not be my last.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Fascinating Alternative WWII History - Reviewed for Historical Tapestry", "unixReviewTime": 1394755200, "reviewTime": "03 14, 2014"}

Ms. Nordin does a wonderful job of drawing the reader in quickly and endearing Eliza to us.Eliza was a prostitute in the bustling city of Omaha, but now she's in South Dakota to work for the sister of a pastor friend of hers. Except the woman has passed away unexpectedly, leaving Eliza unsure what to do next. She's approached by the town mute, John, who mistakes her for his mail-order bride. Once Eliza explains she is not the bride and it seems the bride is nowhere to be found, Eliza agrees to work for John until she can find another job and his actual bride arrives.Over time the pair grow comfortable together and John is obviously in love with Eliza, even to the point of trying to take her to the local church whenever they are in town. But Eliza's past is a secret and she says she is unworthy of marrying such a wonderful man.John's brother, Troy, tries in vain to court Eliza, much to John's dismay and Eliza's attempts to dissuade him. And as soon as Eliza admits her feelings for John, his mail order bride arrives! Eliza leaves and works for the town's grouch who eventually discovers her secret past and threatens to tell everybody.I won't give away spoilers except to say that this is a story of true love - so you can imagine what happens in the end, but it's not without some twists and turns.I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick, sweet love story.

You add in a murder mystery, and I am more than sold. Fortunetely this book delivered and I devoured it in less than a day.Tessa isn&#8217;t your normal 16 year old girl, she&#8217;s a Varient. She&#8217;s able to mimic the appearance of anyone she touches. Working for a secret government division Tessa is sent on her first mission. She&#8217;s to take on the life of the latest victim of a serial killer to find out their identity. Her mission turns out to more than she&#8217;s ready for as Tessa deals with secrets, lies, and being a teenage girl seeing what it&#8217;s like to be normal for the first time in her life.I loved everything about this book. It grabbed my attention from the beginning and held on to it until the very end. Tessa was incredibly easy to relate to even though she was dealing with not so everyday problems. She also had to deal with normal teenage feelings and problems along with the problems that came with being a Varient. Tessa, although unsure of herself, proves to be a braver and stronger as the book goes on. She&#8217;s determined to prove herself to prove herself and as agent and to not let anyone down. All of this just made Tessa even more likeable.The murder mystery held it&#8217;s own within the book. There were lots of twists and turns, and when I was positive I knew who the real killer was, I was entirely surprised. I couldn&#8217;t for the life of me figure out what the killer&#8217;s motive was until it was all revealed. I&#8217;m usually good at this stuff. I was a lot of crime dramas. The reveal was exciting,and I wasn&#8217;t sure how it was all going to turn out.As for Alec and his relationship with Tessa, I&#8217;m a bit on the fence about it. I feel like I didn&#8217;t get to know enough about Alec to really get a feel for him and his feelings for Tessa. I&#8217;m also confused about some of his actions toward her. Hopefully this will be resolved in the next book. Either way, I loved Tessa and the story enough to overlook it.If you&#8217;re looking for a combinations of X-Men, Veronica Mars, and maybe a bit of Criminal Minds then this is definitely the book for you.

I was really looking forward to this one as it was set in San Francisco during WWII. This was a hard time for everyone especially the Japanese who were put in internment camps. The book tells the story of three girls who are out to make their name and fortune in show business. Grace was raised in the Mid-west and knew no other Orientals. Ruby was raised in a rambunctious family in Hawaii and has no known inhibitions. Helen was raised in a traditional Chinese family and still lives at home.It is interesting to see how these girls make their way with very limited opportunities. It really deals with the rampant discrimination of the times. They were really path setters as most women stayed at home and didn't work. Then the war came and all of a sudden women were able to work. The story deals with the war times and internment  and people passing themselves off as someone they are not.So what bothered me? I found it hard to believe these girls were friends. They were quite mean and manipulating to each other. They fought over men and work. They fought over family secrets and money. In fact, there was nothing they didn't fight about. There were instances of abuse that seemed unrealistic and unnecessary. The main love interest, Joe, is really unappealing. I didn't understand the attraction at all.Still, Lisa See is a great writer. The book deals with a lot of issues and explores an area that I knew little about.

I own all of their books, and most of those books I use regularly, but I have to say Veganomicon is not one that I use often. Simply put I don&#8217;t love it, and it&#8217;s not because the recipes aren&#8217;t good - virtually all of the ones I&#8217;ve made so far have been stellar -  my biggest complaint is the layout. I hate it, The pages of this book are busy to the point of overflowing with ingredients, instructions and tips. Don&#8217;t get me wrong I have no qualm with long ingredient lists, and I love the helpful tips but each page has at least 2 recipes on it. I hate the way the recipes are split over more then one page as this can make it difficult when actually trying to follow the recipe in the kitchen. It may seem silly, but this really is the sole reason that I rarely use the book. If it had a better layout I&#8217;d probably use it a lot more. Other negative points that some people may be interested in are there is a real lack of photos in the book - just a color photo insert in the center - and there is no nutritional information listed for the recipes. Also some of the recipes seem needlessly long or overly complicated with several time consuming steps.Having said that there are a lot of positives about the book as well. For one it&#8217;s a tome, massive, and filled to the brim with tasty recipes for appetizers, soups, salads, dressings, sauces, proteins, one-pot meals, casseroles, grains, vegetable side dishes, and desserts. There&#8217;s also a large section in the front of the book that details basic cooking techniques, how to fill your vegan pantry, what utensils and cooking equipment is best and general tips on prepping and cooking various vegetables, grains etc... As I said early most recipes also include an additional hint about an ingredient, a cooking method, or what else can be done with the finished product. I got my copy of Veganomicon in 2010 when I was relatively new to veganism and I did find much of this information very helpful. Moskowitz and Romero also make cooking seem effortless, they have a really easy-going down to earth writing style that I appreciate, and I love their sense of humor. I also really appriciate their emphasis on whole foods rather then processed foods. They include a few recipes for making your own seitan, tofu mayo, and other vegan staples.Unfortunately though many of the dishes sound delicious I haven&#8217;t cooked as many recipes from this book that I&#8217;d like. Of the ones I have tried here&#8217;s what I thought...Spicy Tempeh Nori Rolls - Loved it!Grilled Yuca Tortillas - Loved it!Butternut Squash and Pumpkin Seed Rice Paper Rolls - Loved itSamosa Stuffed Baked Potatoes - Loved itCurried Carrot Dip - Loved itWalnut Mushroom Pate - Loved itMediterranean-Style Cashew-Cucumber Dip - Loved it, this is seriously the best Tzatziki dip I&#8217;ve had vegan or otherwise.

I&#8217;ve been reading these stories since the beginning and I was so captivated by her lovely descriptions of Charleston, South Carolina, that I visited that beautifully historic southern city a few years ago&#8230;and I can&#8217;t wait to go back.I recommend reading this series in order, for the progression of Theodosia&#8217;s relationships and residences, and also because some secondary characters that (ahem) may no longer be around.These are lighthearted mysteries featuring Theodosia Browning, an enterprising youngish woman who owns the Indigo Tea Shop in Charleston. Along with her master tea blender, the debonair and classically elegant Drayton Connelly, and Haley, her indomitably creative and efficient chef extraordinaire, they create a little haven of heaven with their delicious offerings and their comforting atmosphere.Of course, Theodosia also stumbles into mystery. In this story, a dead body falls out of a wine barrel at Knighthall Winery&#8217;s wine-tasting party. As always, Theodosia is on hand and, since Drayton&#8217;s friend is the winery&#8217;s owner, she agrees to look into things.The best part of the story, however&#8212;and indeed, the entire series&#8212;is the little details: what the Indigo Tea Shop is serving for lunch, their oh-so-creatively themed tea parties, the colorful and sometimes wacky business owners in Charleston&#8212;including Delaine Dish, the slightly manic owner of a woman&#8217;s clothing store, Cotton Duck&#8212;and the descriptions of the beautiful city of Charleston. In this story, we also get a little education on the winery industry and, because the featured businesses are all small, there&#8217;s some interesting information about running a business in general as well.Theodosia Browning is a beautiful woman and she always seems to have a different boyfriend with each book, but there&#8217;s no serious love interest or love play here, only friendship.As always, Childs includes recipes for food to accompany tea, tea party theme ideas, as well as web sites, tea industry magazines, Charleston tourist information, and even lists of fine tea purveyors and tea plantations.A thoroughly enjoyable mystery and series and a sweet lovely ode to the city of Charleston.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Steeped in Evil by Laura Childs", "unixReviewTime": 1398297600, "reviewTime": "04 24, 2014"}

Many of the cases are weird or lurid, so the book is quite entertaining.  The presentation is sufficiently scholarly that the cases will be useful paradigms for others investigating epistomology or religiosity, though Sacks touches only lightly on these issues.  There is a good index and an excellent bibliography.The cases chosen are mostly not people who are &#34;crazy,&#34; and part of the point must be that the range of normal human ability and experience is much wider than most of us believed.  I hope this is consoling to practitioners in mental health; I note that some other readers were offended to read that not only saints have visions and, yes, doctors often abuse drugs.As far as science goes, there isn't much.  Sacks observes that poking specific parts of the brain can produce certain effects fairly consistently, and he offers some conjectures and hypotheses as to why, but the bottom line is that we really don't know.  This is how science begins, collecting and sorting observations, and poking things to see if something will happen.  I think Sacks' books provide a valuable service in disseminating expertly documented case studies which others can build upon to devise better experiments and theories.They are good reads.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Observation Phase of Science", "unixReviewTime": 1403481600, "reviewTime": "06 23, 2014"}

The covers are gorgeous! How could it have not caught my eye. The only reason I hadn't picked up one of the books is that I hadn't read much from the 1920's. Thankfully that has all changed and I have just fallen in love with this era! So, when I saw an opportunity to read this book, I jumped at the chance.I hadn't read anything by Allison before this, but I will say, that her writing style hooks you right from the start and draws you in. I'm looking forward to going back and reading her previous stories in the All For series. Thankfully, each of these books can be read out of order.All for a Sister was an interesting story that led you down a path to discover what the DuFrane family was truly like and the secrets that had been hidden for years. I loved how each point of view was told in a different way. We are introduced to Celeste, a young girl who had had everything handed to her and she is a might spoiled, but as you read through her life in this story, you can't help but feel bad for her and the life she really lived under all the glitz. Her life was far from perfect. And you got to watch her grow-up as the story progressed, literally and emotionally.Unlike Celeste's character, when we are introduced to Dana and until the end, her story is presented like that of a screen play. We are set up for the scene. I loved how her story unfolded, bit by bit and with the little bit of extra description to her life at the beginning of her chapters. You ache for Dana and the life she is forced to live, but I couldn't help be love how she never looses herself despite the circumstances. She holds tight. Yes, she is a bit fearful from the changes in the world around her, but she is a sweet girl.Finally we see the rest of the story, the holes that we can't figure out in Dana's and Celeste's stories, through Celeste's mom, Marguerite, by that of her will. What a character she is. At first, I felt sorry for her and her loss, but as her character unfolds and you witness her merciless actions, any pity that is felt disappears. The complexity to Marguerite was phenomenal, so when all was exposed, you could feel what Dana and Celeste felt when they to discovered the secrets that had been hidden.All for a Sister kept me turning pages. Each chapter brought something new, whether it was a question or an answer, I had to keep reading.I enjoyed all of these characters. They each played such an important role in the story. The attention to detail was another wonderful bonus to this story that really helped this story pop off of the page. And as I said before, the writing was fantastic. This story offered many twists and turns. When you thought you had it figured out, you were thrown another curve. It kept me glued to the pages.Thank you to Tyndale Blog Network, I received a copy of this book for free in exchange for an honest review.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "This story grabs a hold of you and doesn't let go.", "unixReviewTime": 1404691200, "reviewTime": "07 7, 2014"}

The ultimate compliment I can give these poems is that I wish I wrote them; Howe's style is both accessible and sophisticated and her subject matter is TRULY the Kingdom of Ordinary time. She quests to find the sacred in the profane, or moreover, eliminating the very CATEGORY of profane time and experience. Errands are holy, caring for her ailing mother is communion, and having the same conversation with her daughter after school every day is prayer.I learned a lot as a poet from reading Howe. She expertly uses the concrete image to BECOME the emergent meaning of the poem, rather than ending where it seemed she was headed in he first line. If I have any critique here, it is that many of Howe's poems follow a similar form---expository or introductory image, exploration of that image, and then the introduction of a SEEMINGLY unrelated second concrete image which sheds light through juxtaposition on the first. Again, this is both a strength a minor weakness.

Luckily, I was able to check it out from the library. It's fantastic! I require logic and linear progression of events in order to enjoy a story, and based on the two other books by James which I've read, I picture James as a free spirited, lively person who approaches writing in a joyful though haphazard way. I could be totally wrong, but that's the impression I got. Anyway, there's absolutely nothing haphazard about this book! It's lovely, and the tone and feel actually reminds me of Loretta Chase's belovedLord of Scoundrels.India's an interesting and extremely appealing heroine, along the lines of Sophy in Heyer'sThe Grand Sophy. Her career as a decorator and life organizer to the wealthiest families felt original and was presented in a very convincing manner, with her godmother Adelaide by her side as a chaperone and companion. I love that India charges exorbitant fees to make sure her services are valued and she's treated with respect - so true! Thorn is a typical alpha-male hero, though his childhood spent as a mudlark is interesting and he puts this skill to use in the climax of the story. His protective and loving relationship with Rose and memories of his younger siblings are very endearing.*** Spoiler *** I wish India and Thorn hadn't consummated their relationship prior to Thorn declaring himself. They mutually decide to have sex while Thorn declares he will not marry her and intends to marry Lala. Yuck! That is very hard for me to relate to - why would a woman give herself to a man who clearly and vocally prefers another person? Oh well, this is not an unusual plot device in Regency books, just one that I don't prefer to read. At least India didn't sit around lamenting her actions and was prepared to move on - I could admire her resolve and strength.  *** End Spoiler ***Overall outstanding book that I would read again. 4.5 stars, minus half star for what I stated in my spoiler.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Fantastic!", "unixReviewTime": 1403913600, "reviewTime": "06 28, 2014"}

Addy's strength and life made her a unique heroine and I have to say she is an inspiration considering all of the struggles she endured. Her relationship with her fellow &#34;girls&#34; and horrible Nate, cruel Zane and quiet Jackson were well written and well defined.I appreciated the author's opening note about the prevalence and severity of human trafficking and was grateful that the book did not go into explicit detail in every scene. There was a great balance between detail and implication because the book didn't need the gore and emotional trauma to be riveting- it was perfect on its own.The only negative thing I can say about the book is how easily it ended and how fast it was wrapped up. I loved the ending but thought it lost some of the realistic feel the rest of the book held. I wonder if novellas in the POV of the other girls, or Zane are in the works. I would have also liked to hear about how the family was struggling or the search efforts, but it wouldn't have added to the plot except in length so I can see why it wasn't included.Overall, a great book, but not for the faint of heart.

After dozens of books casting Woodvilles as evil, Yorkists as saviors, and Lancastrians as inept usurpers, this author will make you rethink the stereotypes and assumptions. In this particular novel, it is Margaret of Anjou we are tempted to think of as a devoted and upstanding queen rather than the she-wolf ravaging England with her hired mercenaries.It was a challenge. While I don't know that I feel much more sympathy for Margaret after this reading, I certainly mourned for each follower of hers who was slain fighting for her lost cause. How I would love to get a moment with one of these noblemen so that I could ask them, &#34;What made you go forth to an almost certain death in an attempt to put the addled descendant of a Lancastrian usurper back on the throne?&#34;Higginbotham corrects some often stated assumptions about Margaret, such as the one that has her ordering the heads of York, Salisbury, and Rutland to be displayed on the gate at York. Other authors have Margaret personally leading and commanding troops which is unlikely to have ever happened. Unfortunately, even this more realistic look at Margaret made me wish she had just chosen to retire into obscurity rather than continue to rile up dissention in favor of her husband who she admits is not fit to rule.Maybe I've read too much Yorkist propaganda, but I felt like the reasons for the rebellion were not really given. We are supposed to sympathize with Henry because these noblemen are inexplicably turning against him, but of course that's not true. There were reasons, otherwise why would men fight for Richard and then Edward?Though Higginbotham does an exemplary job of writing historical characters from a refreshing point of view and uses the switching first person point of view better than anyone else, I still have a difficult time really liking anyone in this book. Maybe they're too real and nobody stands out as a hero or victim, but I wanted someone to stand out and make me want to get out there and fight myself.Overall, this is a very thoughtful and well-researched look at the Wars of the Roses.

He says accounts of the massacre are &#8220;hotly contested.&#8221; In other words, the truth cannot be ascertained. Gordis whitewashes the massacre, a war crime atrocity which is one chapter in the Israeli holocaust of the Palestinians. This type of holocaust denial will not land the denier in jail. There is not even a plaque marking the site of the Deir Yassin massacre. Never forget? When it comes to Israeli slaughters of Palestinians it is incumbent on us to forget in order to qualify as morally respectable in western eyes.Early in the morning of April 9, 1948, commandos of the Irgun, among whom was Mr. Gordis&#8217; hero Menachem Begin, and members of the Stern Gang, attacked Deir Yassin, an Arab village. It was several weeks before the end of the British Mandate and the declaration of the State of Israel. The village lay outside the area to be assigned by the United Nations to the Jewish state; it had a peaceful reputation; it was even said by a Jewish newspaper to have driven out some Arab militants. But it was located on high ground in the corridor between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and with the knowledge of the mainstream Jewish defense force, the Haganah, it was to be conquered and held.In spite of being better armed, the two Zionist terror gangs were at first unable to conquer the village. But after they elicited the help of a small band of Palmach troops (the elite fighters of the Haganah), Deir Yassin soon fell. The Palmach soldiers left; it was then that the massacre began. That evening over tea and cookies, in the neighboring Zionist settlement of Givat Shaul, the Jewish terrorist told foreign correspondents that over 200 Arabs were killed and forty taken prisoner. This was reported in the New York Times the very next day (April 10, 1948, p. 6).The Judaic terrorists claimed to have lost four of their own. They boasted of the &#34;battle&#34; but made no mention of the male Palestinians whom they had loaded onto trucks, paraded through some Jewish sections of Jerusalem, and then taken back to a stone quarry between Givat Shaul and Deir Yassin and shot to death. On April 13, 1948 the New York Times reported that 254 Arab men, women, and children had been killed at Deir Yassin; there was no mention of prisoners.The official Zionist leaders of the Haganah denounced the dissidents of the Irgun and the Stern Gang accusing them of massacre, robbery, looting and barbarism. Ben Gurion even sent an apology to King Abdullah. But this horrific act served the future state of Israel well. As Begin said, &#34;Arabs throughout the country, induced to believe wild tales of 'Irgun butchery' were seized with limitless panic and started to flee for their lives. This mass flight soon developed into a maddened, uncontrollable stampede. The political and economic significance of this development can hardly be over estimated.&#8221; (Begin, &#34;The Revolt,&#34; p.164)  While modern historians argue that Begin's claims were exaggerated and that the actual number of Arabs killed was closer to 100, they all agree that the massacre at Deir Yassin marked the beginning of the depopulation of over 400 Arab villages and the exile of over 700,000 Palestinians.In spite of protests by Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other noted scholars, within a year the village was repopulated with orthodox Judaic immigrants from Poland, Rumania and Slovakia. Its Palestinian cemetery was bulldozed and its name was wiped off the map. It is today completely obliterated. The massacre site is a few hundred yards from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum dedicated to victims of the Nazis. Yad Vashem makes no mention of the massacre of Arabs by the Judaic Nazis among whom we number Menachem Begin. Gordis has written a whitewash of a mass murderer.

It is a storybook.  To write a story requires the author to choose a perspective and stick with it.  Read this knowing you do not get anything like a detailed portrait of the available information on any one topic.  Read it knowing you get the author's choice of interpretation and a selection of the supporting and competing information that is available, but only to the extent that would support an enjoyable and absorbing STORY.Further, Bauer is mainly concerned with written documentation.  This is not, in and of itself, a problem, but the impression one gets is that the stories, documents and mythologies of a people are more or less homogeneous across time and space and therefore can be considered at close to face value.  Obviously this is a very tricky thing.  Consider ancient Egypt: at any time in Egyptian history, perspectives on their own past varied; a written document shows not so much anything reliable about its topic, but about the life and times of its author.Bauer is aware of the limitations of her method.  I would not say that this book in any way misrepresents what it in fact offers.  I do disagree with her interpretations in quite a few areas, but I don't object to her method and I can read the book with the &#34;ifs, ands, and buts&#34; in the back of my mind because I'm aware of the additional information out there on the topics.  I still find the book helpful for its broad focus, and worth reading.In other words, if the transition to agricultural economies, for example, is an area of prehistory that fascinates you, do move on to textbooks and learn how much more information is out there, as well as how much less certain any particular viewpoint on the period actually is.

Throughout characters die unnecessarily and horribly and the ending is depressing enough to make one sorry for having slogged through this book's horrors.I find it disturbing that the author, representing what passes for our culture's best and brightest, found it necessary to invent so much cruelty and, also, in the end, kill off one of the characters who was emblematic of why the war was fought at all.  The book's ending makes it clear that for our culture's elites, life is a constant series of wars between equally amoral titans, wherein normal people serve as nothing more than instruments for the titans' ambitions.Disturbing as well is the implication arising from the book's ending that a coal miner's offspring can never become accomplished enough to earn themselves a place among the Capitol's elites, because it makes available to them just two possibilities: try and die, or return home broken in body and spirit.

Lifelong competitors, they team up when tragedy strikes and discover each other in an opposites attract sort of way, except they are not so different.A light-hearted romance, I enjoyed from cover to cover. This was the kind of book I like to read to just lazily pass an afternoon. Of course, I am a slow reader so I would never be able to read a book like this in one afternoon, but I did finish it rather quickly. The story is part of a series but definitely could be a standalone.I loved the characters and the idea of two professionally-driven, competitive, type A personalities getting over themselves enough to fall for each other. Watching them come together was fun and entertaining. Romance is less graphic than other contemporary romance novels, there and sometimes graphic but sometimes told not shown. This is the kind of nice, cute story that makes you want to just&#8230;sigh.That is the good news. The bad news is this story is full of plot holes.I am not sure how believable it really is for Kory to fall for her high school bully. It would have been better if Will had simply been an arrogant rival or if Kory had preconceived notions about the &#8220;son of a Mitchell&#8221;. As it was, he made fun of her and had an entire class making fun of her. And as much of a stretch as it is for a neurologist to want to settle for chronic care in a nursing home, that part is actually realistic in a Doc-Hollywood-Michael-J.-Fox sort of a way. It is the bit about the nursing home that is not. Most of the work in a nursing home is done by CNAs and overseen by an RN. A doctor is merely on-call. The other piece that just doesn&#8217;t make sense is the medical directorship in Chicago. There are 80 hospitals in the Chicagoland area and an entire medical district within the city made up of three major hospitals, not to mention the Rehab Institute. There is no way a still wet-behind-the-ears student, no matter how bright, would be offered the position of a medical director. Competition is just way too steep.If you can get past these discrepancies (I did), the story here is pretty good. Really good. In fact, I wholeheartedly recommend this, but for adult readers due to graphic sexual content.Disclaimer: All books reviewed by me have been received via purchase, lending, or given to me by an author or publisher for the purposes of an honest review.

A shift between the two worlds - a hunt for magical treasures is followed by a return to normal life at home and the slipping away of whether it ever happened at all.

Sowa \"I am an avid reader, mother of two, ...", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "Afterparty ended up being one of those books that I thought was one thing, but turned out to be something else, entirely.  The writing and dialogue in this book charmed me, and while I know it won&#8217;t be for everyone, I thought that Emma&#8217;s inner dialogue and sense of humor brought a lot to the story.  I liked Emma, and I could relate to her, so I guess I was drawn in by her obvious need to get out from her her father&#8217;s watchful eye and her strong inner conscience that with which she is always at war.  Her move to LA is ushered in with a kiss from a stranger at a beach club, which seemed strange at the time, but really set the tone for what Emma would experience in her new home.  The income level and lifestyle of the teens at Emma&#8217;s new school is not one that many of the readers will have first hand experience with, but I thought the book did a good job of showing how the wealth and privilege most certainly did not buy happiness for anyone. Another standout for me was the presence of a single parent that did not just disappear.  So often in YA it seems that the single parent dynamic is used an an excuse to eliminate all adult oversight, but Emma&#8217;s father, while perhaps a bit naive at times, did not fade into the background, and I appreciated that because I think it really gave me a good idea of Emma&#8217;s character and the inner conflict she was experiencing.Afterparty was dramatic, and there was a certain guilty pleasure aspect to the story, but this book was also about Emma struggle with who she is.  It wasn&#8217;t just the usual, I am a teen and must test boundaries stuff, although there was a bit of that, but it was also about Emma&#8217;s whole family history.  Her mother&#8217;s addiction, and her father&#8217;s unwillingness to discuss it, weighs heavily on Emma&#8217;s identity and her friendships and romances are all colored by the voice in the back of Emma&#8217;s head that constantly wonders if she will turn into the woman that has essentially haunted her small family unit all these years.  Her friend Siobhan, who will strike fear and sympathy into the heart of any parent reading this book, was a great catalyst for a lot of the drama.  On one hand, she was the defense against the mean girls at school, but on the other hand, she was as self-destructive as they come and some of her escapades truly made me cringe.  Dylan, who in many ways was the male equivalent of Siobhan, was an interesting romantic interest for both girls.In the end, Afterparty was a book that combined indulgent fun with a story that had a very strong moral compass.  Without being preachy in any way, it showed the snapshot of a journey that contained a lot of conflict, doubt, and ultimately a resolution that balanced entertaining with satisfying.  It was a book that artfully combined a thoughtful story with pure entertainment.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "entertaining and thought provoking", "unixReviewTime": 1389225600, "reviewTime": "01 9, 2014"}

The book switches between multiple POVs so the reader gets to understand the motivations behind the actions of all the major forces, which I felt was a good move considering the setup of the storyline.The plot moves along at a pretty quick pace, although I did find it irritating at times. The chapters are so short that I could never find a natural stopping point. I always had to stop in the middle of something important &#8212; that probably sounds like a stupid criticism, but it did negatively impact my reading experience. The book read like a race instead of roller coaster; there were no ups and downs. It was all the same, fast pace, amplified by the structure.The story moves through several different settings, and while a couple of them seemed pretty generic (hotels and the like), the shifting surroundings for all the similar dangerous situations kept the plot points pretty fresh throughout. Overall, the world-building was solid.Mostly, I thought this was a good read. Great characters. Good storyline. Iffy structure._____WritingLots of third person POVs. Five or six?

Not just helping others, but performing what are essentially exorcisms.  To collect the &#34;haunted&#34; objects is creepy, but not scary, just weird.  Especially the doll.  I would have burned it!Sylvie does not act like the intelligent girl we are led to believe she is.  She is not a little girl, she is 14.  Old enough to tell the truth.  Old enough to stand up to her sister.  Old enough to speak up and say, &#34;We have no food in the house.&#34;  I can only figure she ate school lunches, or she would have literally starved!  Even when the book goes back in time, Sylvie is not a little girl.  So, no way would the &#34;good girl&#34; cover for her sister.  That scene with Dot was over the top ridiculous!  Not the least bit believable that 1) it would happen 2) Sylvie wouldn't tell 3) Dot would keep quiet!Is Rose (daughter Rose) a victim of her upbringing? Is she acting out?  I don't think so.  She sounds like a sociopath.  Perhaps that is what the author intended, but I got the idea we were supposed to blame the parents, particularly the father.  At what point did she go &#34;bad?&#34;  Before she was sent away for lesbian tendencies, that's clear.  That was a surprise, finding out the &#34;school&#34; she was sent to was to reprogram her to &#34;Biblical thinking,&#34; and not for her poor behavior.  But, to know who murdered your parents and not tell?  It takes an awfully messed up teenager (adult, but still a teen) to do that.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Just okay... some spoilers", "unixReviewTime": 1396742400, "reviewTime": "04 6, 2014"}

These ladies have upped the ante for how books in a series should be written. I have loved their books so far but this one sucked me in from the first paragraph. I will be singing praises for Beautiful Player (and the rest of the series) for a VERY LONG time!!Brief Synopsis:Hanna is a brilliant overachiever who lives a pretty regimented life in order to achieve her next career goal; no matter the cost of her social life. When her brother challenges her to quit being so self-isolating, he puts her in touch with his best friend, Will, in hopes that he can bring her out of her shell and perhaps show her the ropes on some sort of social balance. What nobody expected was the immediate chemistry between the two.Will is a bit of a player. But he's also stuck in a routine that clearly defines his daily life. And he has no plans to change that; until a whirlwind of bottled up surprises comes storming into his life. He agrees to helping bring his best friends little sister out of her draining rut and show her around, as friends. But Hanna is not at all the young girl he barely remembers. He may have just met his unexpected match.My Review:Where to begin?! I have been waiting what feels like months for a story to consume me from start to finish. I do have to say that this is a bit of an understatement. This book swallowed me whole and I am still enjoying the after effects several days later. Reading from a dual POV, I fell in love with the backstory of these characters, the undeniable attraction and the downright naughty banter. And of course, their intense sexual chemistry is so incredibly steamy.\"I'm thinking about how naive and sweet you are. I'm wondering what I've agreed to do here, when I said I would help you figure out the whole dating world. I'm worried I'm going to make you into the most vulnerable bombshell in the history of the planet.\"Hanna is so full of surprises, I found myself with tears streaming down my face several times from laughing so hard.Will: \"Do you even know what a triathlon is?\"  Hanna: \"Of course I do. It's the swim, run, shoot a bear thing.\"Hanna is so incredibly down to earth, just stuck in a rut created by her ingrained drive to stay focused and achieve her next goal. She's had a thing for Will since her childhood, but knowing about his lifestyle of dating beautiful women...often, she enlists his help in figuring out the opposite sex. Her plan is to get in, learn from the master and then escape unharmed. Her plan goes to s*** the moment she sees him for the first time in years.\"Did I want him to just be my brother's friend, helping me find more balance? Or did I want to get a grown-up look at the object of my filthiest fantasies?\"Will is so sweet, so incredibly loveable and above all, naughty as sin.\"Hanna was this uninhibited, self-possessed woman in front of me who I was pretty sure was going to effectively wreck my world.\"Hanna and Will are going down as two of my favorite characters I've ever read about. They are both absently searching for something more in their lives, not knowing that what either of them really need is each other. I loved absolutely everything about this book. I'm a sucker for adorable nicknames and I think this one takes the cake for me: Plum. (Petal from Beautiful Stranger - also in this series - is a very super close second place). These authors nailed this book. I didn't feel like I was reading a book thrown together for the sake of extending a series that should have been done several books ago. I truly felt the depth of these characters and their blind need for each other.High-fives to these two authors who have created an amazingly captivating series with characters that are so relatable and funny.

Rather the book is collection of vignettes, some of about Mma Ramotswe's father and others about hear life and how she grew up to become a detective.There were sad things that happened in her life, but I disagree with reviewers who say she had a hard life. She seemed to have had a happy life with some sad moments in it and the book reflects her overall joy at being.Mma Ramotswe is a fascinating and very real character with her own ideas about the world. She's fiercely proud of her nation, and she's proud to be a Size 22 woman in a cultural that's traditionally valued women who are fat. She is usually very self-confident.She has to be, in selling her father's cattle and taking on the job of starting the first lady run detective agency in the country with nothing other than her reading of fiction and a detective manual. That takes guts. Her cases are filled with lots of high points and a few low points as she's still learning what she's doing. She does stumble occasionally such as in her following the daughter of a wealthy East Indian man, and the way she obtained evidence of one woman's husband's infidelity. Still, she also showed her keen mind when she found the secret of a doctor whose talents and knowledge seemed to vary from one day to the next, as well as the case of a man who disappeared during his own Baptism, and the case of the missing boy.More than just being a mystery book, what Alexander McCall Smith provides readers an experience. While the book is stereotypically viewed as of interest to middle aged women, it really is a great book for any human to read (and who knows, maybe some extraterrestrials too) as we experience rich character and rich settings which are unforgettable.I listened to the audiobook version and have to commend the narration of Lisette Lecat who does a fantastic job bringing this story to life and creating each character, regardless of gender.

They are so well written. Ace and London are super hot together!Plot/Storyline- Okay, the plot and story were AMAZING! I couldn't put the book down. The love story (not your conventional hearts and flowers relationship, but I loved that) was awesome and the added drama and action just made this story addictive. It was a great emotional and mental ride ;)Steam Factor- Get out your sham wow panties!! Ace KNOWS how to please a woman and things get down and dirty at times. Raw and hot as hell!!Cover- Sexy, just like ACE!!Cliffhanger- Nope. This is a standalone. No HEA though.Overall- I REALLY, REALLY, REALLY enjoyed this book... all the way up to the end. The end just deflated the whole story for me. The entire book was great and very well written, but I'm a HEA person and this book doesn't deliver for that need.We meet London, who happens to be a walking bad luck charm. Everyone around her dies. First her parents, then her brother, and others. Her whole life is quite upsetting and just one bad circumstance after another.  The loss of her parent's is the reason her brother, Jonah, starts to work for Ace in order to make lots of money to support London with her expenses (housing and college); despite it being illegally earned.  Things go wrong during an exchange and London is left alone with no living relatives.Ace and Jonah were pretty close so Ace takes London in under his wing after Jonah passes.  There is a lot more that goes on between Ace and Jonah that you find out throughout the story and explains the REAL reason why Ace takes in London after Jonah's passing, but I won't go into that so that you can enjoy the story yourself.When Ace and London interact, there is a strong attraction and they both lust for each other. The sexual tension is fun to read as well as the actual sex. Their sexual interactions are so raw and primal and sexy as hell. Ace makes me want to start dressing in silk and pearls.... wink,wink.The story's ability to pull you in with the love story and the action/suspense aspect was perfectly executed.  The writing was spot on with plot/story details and character development. I was consumed with the story and was happy with the flow and delivery throughout the entire book. There was never a moment where I wanted to set the book down unless I had to. That was... until the end!! I wanted to throw my iPad and then call Shanora myself and ask her why she would just keep dealing London a rotten hand in life. The ending was so frustrating, but I am an HEA addict, so if you're good with an ending that doesn't end happily (because not all stories do, but I avoid them) then I HIGHLY recommend you read this book because the story is AMAZING and you will love it!!Shanora, I tip my hat to you in your amazing ability to tell a story. I ate up every last word and was able to fully lose myself in your story, BUT the ending girl!! I needed an HEA after all the crap London had to deal with in life, I needed it for me and for her. Thank you for the escape and for giving us the privilege to read your creative work. XOXO ;)***Favorite Quotes:&#8220;You don&#8217;t scare me,&#8221; I whisper.

We have your disaster scenario and the coping mechanisms of a population, though it&#8217;s reduced to a microcosm through the perspectives of two characters. Ross represents the moral dissolution that may be required to survive in such a scenario, while Rooster represents the chaos itself. There is a lot of depth in these characters, and further discussing their metamorphosis would spoil the novel.There are plenty of scenes that include graphic violence and some disgusting truths. Rocky Alexander provided several moments were survival skills and a degree of common sense betrayed an amount of painstaking care that was applied to this story. Fans of apocalyptic-survival scenarios will find plenty to love here. The zombies themselves are a serious threat; the amount of detail used to describe them heightens the tension, especially when Alexander uses the plague/germ idea to indicate that everything and anything can be dangerous.Ross&#8217;s iron will and determination made him a compelling character, especially during the unforgettable trek through a wintry land.

The book takes place in 3 cities, Manhattan (no outer boroughs in Tartt's New York), Las Vegas, and Amsterdam.  I've been in all 3 cities, and Tartt gets each of them -- Manhattan with its elegant towers and parks and multi-ethnic neighborhoods; Vegas where subdivisions fade into the desert; and Amsterdam with narrow houses, canals, and labyrinthine streets.  But the description goes on for pages and pages (I imagine, since I read it on a Kindle) with nothing happening --just endless word pictures.The book is as full of interesting characters as a Dickens novel, but one never sees inside any of the characters.  Even Theo is a bit of a cipher.  He's constantly taking drugs -- halfway through the book we learn that the pills and heroin keep his paranoia at bay.  Well,, it makes sense that a man caught in a terrorist attack would be paranoid, but how about showing and not telling?  All that verbiage, but not a word until then about Theo's fears and how the drugs keep those fears at bay.  Andy, the school friend whose family takes Theo in, has been bullied by his siblings; this we learn in retrospect -- not while its ongoing.There's a lot of action in this book, be it the drawing room drama of the Barbour family or the derring-do of various underworld figures in New York, Vegas, and Amsterdam, but all of this is rather muddy.  When the book revs up, it's so fast and furious that it's hard to tell what exactly is happening.  Boris,, Theo's Russian gangster buddy, always seems to have some kind of racket going on, and he sort of explains it, in his thickly accented English, but clearly enough for someone like me who hasn't had to deal with art thieves or international gangs.  It all has something to do with a kingpin named Sascha, and there's some guy named Horst who's a baddie with an appreciation for art, but how this all fits together is really confusing.  In fact, most of the action-packed sections of the book go by in fog and smoke.  Why is the Metropolitan Museum attacked?  What is Boris doing behind Theo's back in Vegas?  Is Theo's father just making bad bets, or does he have some other kind of racket?  And who is Lucius Reeve?

Mind spiraling, constantly strategizing in the outside world for how I could get my needs met, never succeeding, because underneath all my strategies was insecurity, confusion as to what those needs even were, etc. I was clinging, emotionally grasping, unknowingly turning off the very people from whom I was seeking comfort and stability.I was in so much pain that I was willing to sit down and put the time in and do what is suggested in the book.And my whole world changed. It's too long of a process to describe here, but I learned how to FEEL what was going on, and therefore move the pain through and out of my body, all the while in the very process of doing that sending myself and my past pain the love that it was so seeking from outside myself.Don't get me wrong, I've long since gotten over the whole &#34;loving ourselves is enough&#34; mentality of the bohemian and feminist movement that I was very much a part of. We are human, we were meant for closeness and intimacy. So I don't think the goal is to just learn how to &#34;go it&#34; alone how I always thought we should be able to before. But this book helped me love myself so utterly and deeply that I knew how to take care of myself through my hurts so that I could then communicate authentically, not manipulatively. I was able to state what I needed and how I needed to care for myself. No more grasping. No more desperation. Unless, of course, you're talking about the desperation I felt to continue to connect on a daily basis with what I discovered to be the most beautiful, soft, radiant, warm, loving part of myself. Doing these practices became my favorite part of every day. I became addicted to loving and discovering myself!!! :-)  That then started drawing people TOWARDS me, because for the first time I was connected to it myself.Some people have said some of the exercises are hokey, and the term &#34;inner child&#34; turns some people off. Please, don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Our inner child is just the FEELING, emotional and receptive part of ourselves. Not our intellectual, thinking, heady part that always uses strategizing in the outer world as a solution, often completely missing the mark in its best attempt to meet our needs, because we've never even learned how to tune into what we're REALLY wanting and needing. This book teaches you how to do it.My only complaint is the book title. It just doesn't really suffice for what the book is about. To me, it makes it sound like it's only for people who don't  have community and friends and feel alone. No, it's about connecting with the part of you that is so wholly beautiful, tender, and loving inside, and radiating that outward naturally so that you are in a state of constant feeling of Oneness and connection.

I likey : )) What a fantastic start to what Im sure will be an amazing series. You know how you can tell you&#8217;re reading a fantasy? Its not the telekinesis or the transporting from realm to realm. Its not that there are Gods and Demi-Gods or mating frenzy&#8217;s or even hell hounds. Nope. How you can tell you&#8217;re reading a fantasy, is when a man tells you that he will financially support your shoe habit and he means it. I think I fell a little bit more in love with Uri when he agreed to this.Lets see if I can attempt to explain what the story is about. The Gods have really messed up the realms and were doing terrible things to other Immortals. So the &#8220;Creator&#8221; has charged 11 Guardians to watch over the realms while the Gods are punished and put to sleep until they&#8217;re needed again. This story is about Urian and Alexandra (Alex). These two have been eyebanging each other for centuries. Urian and his fellow Guardian and friend, Gregoire visit BDSM clubs and have sex with human females and sometimes Alex will show up and watch (Mmmm, delicious and hawt!).Alex has &#8220;visions&#8221; or &#8220;mind hops&#8221; and tries to help this woman she knows has been kidnapped and is currently being tortured. Well, then stuff start to happen and that&#8217;s all I can really say without giving anything away.This book has a good story, very dirty and delicious sex, hot hunky men with HUGE members, sexy, strong and smart women, Immortals with some mythology background and light BDSM undertones. From the prologue I was hooked. I had very clear visuals in my head on how the world/realm looked. Then right off the bat we&#8217;re treated to an awesome kinky sex scene in the club! Oh my sweet perverted little mind&#8230; it was really good. Bravo Setta Jay, Bravo!Now for some of the things that I didnt like. There is a huge cast of characters and a lot of confusing names and places. It was difficult to keep everyone straight. It would have made it a lot easier to keep track if there was a glossary of terms, names of people and places and what their job/duty/rank/race and realm is. Also I got really tired of hearing how tall all the men were. It was nice, but not necessary.Overall I flippin loved this book! The sex is super charged hot, the characters are well developed, the story line is unique and interesting and it has a little humor thrown in. I had a couple of laugh out loud moments and I love it when that happens. When Alex and Uri first get together you can almost feel the sexual need pouring out of the pages. I do need to warn you about a rape scene that some people may have a hard time with. However, the way it played out sort of left me conflicted on my feelings about it. You just have read it to understand what Im talking about because I sort of enjoyed it, but I didn&#8217;t at the same time. Uri&#8217;s fellow Guardian, Gregoire is someone I cant wait to read more about. His &#8220;member&#8221; is described to favor his equine half *waggles eyebrows* and I want to ride him like a rodeo queen. I can not wait to read his book!!

Like so many others I came to this book after Ender's Game (which I found to be a true masterpiece) and was so let down by what I found. I read the whole book hoping for it to get better, for some of the genius in Ender's Game to come through, but the story never did.First of all, this book isn't a sermon about Catholicism, it actually bashes it. A lot of it seemed to me like the author was thumbing his nose at Catholic beliefs and trying to glorify his own religion in the book. (No, I'm not Catholic) Funny how people see &#34;Catholic&#34; a few times on a page and suddenly they react like someone is trying to convert them.Anywho, there are parts of the book that work. The aliens weren't really a problem for me.  It was interesting-ish albeit slow. (Spoilers follow)  My main issue was with the characterization  of so many characters in this book. Ender has changed into this overly feeling guy. It's like the other extreme of what he was in the first book. I haven't read Ender in Exile yet, maybe that's why it's too sudden of a shift for meI was actually laughing at parts near the end where the author forces Ender and Novina together. It was like a bad soap opera or something. After knowing of the existence of a man for four days, of which you sorta spoke like two times in (both of which were quite hostile), suddenly you're all lovely dovey with him? I mean, wth? And with Ender- you see a picture of a young girl and you instantly fall in love with her and want to raise her babies as your own? And the children after having such a crappy father, after a 15 min conversation with Ender suddenly they see that he is the exact father they have always wanted? It's all just so rushed. People who have been in the situations those kids and that woman have been through need wayyy more time than that before they can learn to trust. Granted kids are prone to trust more easily than adults. It'd be a more normal reaction for them to think, &#34;he speaks the truth but he may being doing it to get something from me.&#34; Rather than living in some fairy land where all your magical dreams can come true. Too much, too soon. This book heavily needed to work on relationship growth. It's too much like a story you'd tell your kids where they all fall in love at first sight and live happily ever after. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I've never seen anything close to that in real life, which makes it lame to come across in a book for grown upsAlso, this book seemed like it needed an editor to cut down on the wordiness.

Fruge", "helpful": [4, 9], "reviewText": "This review applies to &#34;Space Vengeance&#34;, book three in the Scrapyard Ship series as read on Kindle.In my previous review on &#34;Hab 12&#34;, I indicated the Author was vacillating entirely too much between actual &#34;Sci-Fi&#34; and Fantasy, and should tighten-up his story-telling; this he has failed to do, and in fact has grown worse.&#34;Science&#34; entails the study of known, provable phenomena; whereas &#34;fantasy&#34; does not. &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; postulates scientifically POSSIBLE phenomena which does not yet exist, but may at some point in the future should our scientific knowledge make it so. Too much of what Mr. McGinnis puts forth as &#34;Science-Fiction&#34; is actually &#34;fantasy&#34; since the known laws of science make it impossible. Entertaining fantasy, but NOT &#34;Sci-Fi&#34;.Additionally, I am left to wonder how much (if any) actual military experience Mr. McGinnis has. I am sure that I am not the only veteran who laughed at the ridiculously naive ideas the Author displays as to how the military, especially the Naval branches, work.When you couple the above mentioned military ignorance with his obvious left-wing political bias, which he really makes apparent in this book, you have one man's fantasy about a world and &#34;multiverses&#34; he wished could exist, but never has or will. I mean really... The &#34;Montana Militia&#34; backing a rogue FEMALE Admiral's attempted coup to overthrow the government?!  Laughably ridiculous! The Author seems to know even less about militia groups (especially that one), than he does about the US military! Such propaganda narratives are blown apart by the simple fact that it has been the Leftist extremist groups such as &#34;Red Flag&#34;, the &#34;Weathermen&#34;, and the so-called &#34;People's Liberation&#34; armies of men like Mao, Lenin, and Castro, who throughout history  have been responsible for the bloodiest coups in man's history. How many violent coups have the American militia groups ever attempted? ZERO. How many have Leftist? Numerous.I think it despicable when Writers of a genre of literature, which should be safe from political propaganda use it as a pulpit to propagate their own twisted mis-characterizations. Mr. McGinnis - If your readers want to entertain a political treatise, there are much better source Authors they could resort to. I, like so many others, buy Sci-Fi books seeking a temporary escape from such ugly real-world  concerns. It violates the whole intent of such escapist literature to inject your own political biases into it, much like defecating in the swimming pool; and soon you'll find good folks electing to swim elsewhere.You want to air your views on politics? Fine, but do it within that genre where it may be properly critiqued as such, and rebutted by others.Finally, whereas the Author seems to be a Leftist in other respects, he certainly embraces capitalism where his own financial interests are concerned. These books are becoming thinner (both literally and figuratively) with every issue, and it does seem that the Author is attempting to &#34;milk it&#34; for all he can. No &#34;Tolkein&#34; is he, for sure.I was probably a sucker to buy his third installment in the vain hopes that things would improve; they haven't. So, this will be my last purchase from this Author.I hope others will find this review helpful.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Can you say \"Moo\"?", "unixReviewTime": 1399248000, "reviewTime": "05 5, 2014"}

I can almost guarantee that!This is a story of one girl and two boys who were thick as thieves ... three peas in a pod, as some would say. Katie, Kyle and Derek grew up together and lived next door to each other. The twin Connor boys have all of the girls swooning, with their dark hair and amazing green eyes. Kyle is outgoing, boisterous and just plain fun to be around .. the life of any party. His twin Derek however, is the shy, quiet, romantic type. Derek is the sensible and responsible one, where Kyle is the crazy, die hard partier.One of the boys is over the top in love with Katie, but Katie is over the top in love with the other. It has always been this way.  Katie somtimes thinks that she should go for the one who loves her (since they look exactly alike after all), but the heart wants what the heart wants.The two finally find their way to each other as Katie always dreamed, until tragedy strikes. Over powering, gut wrenching tragedy. This tragedy places a wedge between the young lovers and they each wonder if they will ever make it back to one another. Guilt, confusion, sadness and immense pain play a part in their separation. Will they ever forgive themselves and will they find their way back to love?As soon as I finished this book, I sent Jennifer a message telling her that she made me ugly cry!!

{"reviewerID": "A35ZQ9I8PW65N", "asin": "038536315X", "reviewerName": "carl vartian", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Let me preface this review by saying I have read and enjoyed every book Grisham has written. Generally he is quite entertaining and the reader usually doesn't know what's coming at the end. Sadly, this book isn't up to the same quality of his other legal fiction.He starts with the suicide of a wealthy man who has just  written (as in ink on paper) a new will. The term holographic will should not be strange to any Grisham fan, as his earlier book, The Testament, begins the same way.I will try not to give away anything we learn at the end, although I will say i figured it out very early in this slow reading book. We do learn early on that there is an earlier will, prepared by some hotshot lawyers at a big out of town law firm. It leaves his assets to his kids and grandkids and uses the full extent of legal mumbo jumbo, tax planning and other legerdemain  to minimize the estate taxes due upon one's death. All well and good--the guy was smart, made a lot of money, and didn't want the taxman to get his mitts into his pile of cash. I liked the guy.So, if you have slogged through this book to the end, I'll ask you some simple questions:1. If you wanted to take care of someone, would you wait YEARS until you are literally dead before you did ANYTHING to help that person? There are a lot of ways to transfer assets/cash, with minimal tax consequences.2. If you wanted to leave someone your estate after death, why would you create a freakin' prior will and then hire Jake Brigance to fight the other beneficiaries because you never revoked that earlier will while alive? It would be INSANE to do this. If you hated your family, and Seth makes it clear he did, why ever sit down and create such a document? Even if you changed your mind after creating the first will, send the big shot law firm a notarized (or whatever) letter that simply says I revoke my will of such and such a date, signed Seth Hubbard. Have a nice day! Or go to their office in the flesh, whatever--it is your money and the lawyers are simply carrying out your wishes. You have the right to change your mind. Ask for the original out of their vault (yes there is a will vault) and tear it up with witnesses present. The ultimate revocation!3. Then, have that same hotshot law firm, using the same tax minimizing tricks, create a new will that leaves the money to your beneficiary of choice, again minimizing what the taxman collects, using generation skipping trusts, etc.. This is what a smart businessman like Seth Hubbard would have done.4. Even if you developed memory problems and had forgotten the address of the bigshot law firm, if you knew you were going to kill yourself and that there was definitely going to be a contest over the prior will (see above), why not go to a real lawyer, revoke the prior will and make another one? On the first few pages, we learn that Seth hated lawyers but liked Jake (by reputation). So get down to the Square in Clanton, have Jake make you a new will, which revokes the earlier one and creates new beneficiaries, and THEN go kill yourself.Finally, there are mysteries here, as to the WHY. Without revealing the who, what, when,... we do find out the answers toward the end. Seth does literally nothing to explain things to anyone before he dies, nor does he leave behind any documents that would explain why he did what he did. This is the same guy who buys a grave plot, arranges things with the undertaker, plans who will sing which hymn at his service and names his pallbearers. But he doesn't give any reason for why he leaves his fortune to his housekeeper. It remains for a third party to provide the explanation. Seth has a very valid reason--why on earth would he take that to the grave, knowing that it may remain a mystery for all time? For a guy we keep hearing about was really sharp and knew what he was doing, I really have my doubts.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Plot holes the size of Asia", "unixReviewTime": 1402876800, "reviewTime": "06 16, 2014"}

He is a well-drawn character &#8211; one whom you get to like and really root for. The narrative develops a tension that makes these books &#8220;page turners.&#8221; The problem is that the unraveling of the mystery often has serious flaws. I read this book largely because I was unsatisfied with the last 30 pages or so of its predecessor &#8211; The Beautiful Mystery.First, I thought the Perry Mason finale was kind of cheesy. But there wasn&#8217;t anything a second novel could to fix that. Also, I thought that the idea of a man turning to murderous rage vented on his friend, mentor, supervisor and future father-in-law as a result of oxycontin abuse was equally over the top. I was hoping this was the result of an orchestrated &#8220;sting&#8221; on Gamache&#8217;s part. In the end, I was a bit disappointed.Also, I thought the little town of Three Pines had more than its share of corpses floating up from the surroundings over the whole Gamache series. In the end, it seemed like a better spot than Aruba to knock off your buddies. I guess that&#8217;s why the chief had to settle there or die of terminal boredom.So&#8230; apart from some inconsistency in motive and plot, I&#8217;d recommend all the Gamache books.

Colleen MacGregor turns her life over to God after her marriage to Terence Hayworth is sealed. Colleen works to be the best helpmate she can be while struggle to keep her friendship together with her best friend, Gina. Colleen soon realizes that she has to draw the line at some point. Colleen has a lot of her plate because the man she fell in love with is not the man she married. Colleen&#8217;s world takes a dark turn and she has to come to some harsh decisions.Gina Price loves her best friend but the bible toting and holy than thou act is getting on her last nerve. Gina feels Colleen judges everything she does not that she has not done some questionable things, but her friend should always support her. Gina also does not care for Terence because she has a feeling there is more to him than meets the eye. Gina is dealing with her own issues and does not need a lashing from her friend. Gina is dating Michael but has desires for his brother Keith. The attraction for Keith is one that cannot be ignored but what is she to do especially when Michael has proposed. Gina finds herself in a sticky situation, which will she choose?Terence Hayworth has been preparing for the ministry and now has a wonderful wife to complete his look. Terence&#8217;s mother gives him advice as any mother would until he marries Colleen. Terence&#8217;s mother will do whatever she can to get rid of the new Mrs. Hayworth. Terence has a momma&#8217;s boy mentality that just may cost him everything especially when his wife puts her foot down at the situation. Will Terence learn his lesson? Or will he let his mother ruin his marriage?What I Did Not Like: Terrence&#8217;s mother drove me crazy with frustration.What I Did Like: It was about friendship, family and marriage. It expressed how hard it can be to have friends that are not saved. This book had well-developed characters, drama and suspense. The author does a wonderful job showing Colleen and Terence&#8217;s marriage evolving as the book progressed. I also love the fact that both Colleen and Terence had issues that caused them to stand up for themselves.

You have been successful by all measures the experts give, but you feel somewhat empty&#8211;this book is for you.You are successful by all measures and feel proud, accomplished, maybe like you&#8217;re an expert yourself! Dear pastor, this book is for you.Pastoral ministry is dangerous for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which is that an unhealthy pastor makes an unhealthy church (all things being equal). But of course ministry also has its good times. Anyone seasoned in ministry knows that it &#8220;is a trove of glories and deaths&#8221; (p.24).But the experts aside, what if, as Wilson suggests, real success if faithfulness? Ugh. That&#8217;s harder to measure.

It&#8217;s chapter after chapter speaking to the grand realities of WHO you&#8217;re called to be in light of what you&#8217;re called to do [and is an exposition of sorts of 1 Peter 5:1-11].You&#8217;ll chuckle at the inside jokes known only to pastors.

Not that I was looking for blatant smut but I was hoping for character depth, sexual tension, and perhaps giving in to some passionate feelings like kissing and such. The only sexual scenes are of torture and attempted rape.  It is extremely short and not well written.

On the ship over the 2 sisters dress as young men to avoid problems on the trip over since they don't have male chaperones (a bit of a weak premise).

The h is one of those feisty women who wants to be independent and beyond the control of any man. The H is a womaniser and doesn't want to settle for one woman. They have many encounters and they even become passionately involved but without commitment. Eventually the suitor that the h had back in England comes to claim her as he needs her dowry and he puts her and her family in danger.The interaction between the H and h really annoyed me.

Her earlier works are vibrant, absolutely alive with period detail and color.  They boast a swift tempo with action and suspense harmonized with romance and emotional insight. Her main characters are complex people who develop over time into seasoned and mature persons, credible and likable. The author's typically winning formula hasn't quite come together in this latest novel, in my opinion.  Indeed, her last several novels seem to be more languid and formulaic.  I wonder if Perry is simply getting bored with these characters and this time period?  Death on Blackheath seems tired and often turgid to me. There is a lot of repetitive inner musings by Pitt and not much in the way of real action or suspense.  As his investigation gets bogged down, so does the novel.  Pitt, the recently promoted head of Special Branch has been called in to investigate the sudden disappearance of a housemaid in the home of a naval weapons expert. As the naval race between Britain and Germany was gearing up at the end of the 19th century, it was feared that the maid's disappearance threatened dire implications for national security. That should have provided a tense and urgent scenario for the reader, but somehow, this book never really got off the ground for me.  There were so many thwarted avenues of investigation, not a lot of action, and Pitt's wife Charlotte, a spirited and clever woman who has played important roles in his earlier investigations, has a very limited role in this one. I think a number of Perry fans will find this novel not up to her usual standard, but as every Perry fan also knows, a ho-hum Perry novel is still better than a good many others.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Not my favorite", "unixReviewTime": 1398643200, "reviewTime": "04 28, 2014"}

Each chapter following the coin toss alternates between what might happen depending on who Heart chooses to go with.

I considered titles that included: \"Could Have Been Better\"; \"Genre Mix\", \"Erotica meets Harry Potter\"; and \"I'm So Confused\"I don't know what the category \"new adult romance\" means but in this instance it means a fantasy romance with an Original PLOT/PREMISES,  containing some ineptly described explicit sex scenes, a few sophomoricly suggestive situations and some mildly sexually graphic language.  The main character, Firia's was likeable in some regards but her character development could have been a bit better.  The character development for Mae'lin could have used more depth as well.  We kept being told how sweet, shy and unassuming he was but what else was he?  As for Varuj now there was complexed.  Or was He?  There's action, adventure, and a instance of dubious consent sex.  I liked the magic aspects, the setting and the inclusion of supernatural beings.  It is definitely for readers 18 and older.Overall, I liked this book but I also realized that it could have been better.  If a scene is going to be erotic than I want to feel the provocation.

Learn to identify and practice the basic fundamentals (Make sure you get a coach to make sure you are doing this correctly!)2. Use the fitness and nutrition program to help you train and look like a fighter even if you don't want to be a professional kickboxerThe book is accommodating to both purposes. The book is sequential and very easy to follow along with. The pictures, though, are in black and white and don't always give a lot of detail.

It was well written and paced nicely. I think the characters were well written and had easily distinguishable personalities. I liked how Richard was always in action and would deduce truths and when he would explain things to you and the secondary characters, you'd all realize he was right and the clues were there all along.Law of Nines was descent. However, with First Confessor, his work went down hill. He already had a tendency to preach his beliefs with his characters, but he went overboard trying to jam it down your throat without even advancing the story. So it was only about preaching and not good story writing. The worst part was that all his. Characters sounded the same. They didn't have their own voice. If you were to read their lines with no context, you wouldn't be able to tell one from the other.I don't feel like he covered much ground in the first book of this series. Consider that in the first book of the 1rst series, Richard traveled a lot, defeated Darken Rahl, and became Lord Rahl. Goodkind's writing can't survive inaction and that's my biggest gripe with this book. Over half of this book is of Richard sitting in a cave repeating speeches to a young woman before any action happens. I also think there is an issue with lack of voice here. Richard doesn't start acting in the way I've come to know till the end and I feel that some of the characters act realistically to how a person in there situation would. As an example. There is a young girl you'll read about who is much to forceful when talking to The Lord Rahl for a backwoods hick, even considering her small claim to authority. Just think of how you'd act on meeting someone with much less authority than Richard has, say a cop for instance. So that's how I feel about it, but it's still worth the read.

First there is the absolutely breathtakingly stunning cover.  The very moment I saw it, I knew I&#8217;d be obsessed.  It would take a lot for me to hate a book with that cover.  By looking at it, I never would have guessed the story line, but it fits just perfectly.Can you imagine living your entire life without ever truly seeing the sun? Can you imagine never experiencing the beautiful night sky and all its beauty? What would the world look like with only one and not the other, I wonder? Well, apparently Elizabeth Fama wondered too, because she created a complicated alternate universe from that very idea.This is a dystopian that reads so much more than dystopian.  It has a lot of themes and similarities, but it was so much bigger than that box.  I&#8217;ve been reading dystopian novels since 2010 (and longer if you count the classics), and this one doesn&#8217;t quite fit the mold of the cookie cutter dystopian novel.  I loved that it brought feelings of other books (It reminded me of June and Day in Legend by Marie Lu, when they are together on the streets.  They are so different and June gets to see life through unfiltered eyes for the first time with Day.  It also reminded me of the story Deuce and Fade read together in Enclave, which ironically IS about a boy who lives in the day and a girl who lives at night.  It worked in Enclave and it obviously worked here too.), but it stood on its own.The social issues and injustices are there - they are solid.  You clearly get a picture of what it is like to live in this world, not only as a Smudge (a person allowed to live at night), but as a Ray (person allowed to live in the day).  The best part is watching Sol&#8217;s mind expand as she realizes that while Day&#8217;s have a lot of perks her family wasn&#8217;t afforded, life isn&#8217;t always easier.  There are injustices, especially when it comes to the splitting of families, the tough decisions parents and love ones must make in this world, and law versus doing what&#8217;s right are a major selling point of the book.This book is a clear metaphor &#8212; Days are allowed to live what we would call a normal life &#8212; in the daytime, which a schedule we are used to.  If they are caught breaking the law (aka being out after dark), they are called teenage hijinks.  However, a Night being out in the day is cause for jail time and felonies.  Sol sees this injustice very clearly when she is imprisoned for being out during the day &#8212; even though she is in the hospital tending to a severe injury.  I really liked how well thought out the society was in this respect.While we learn about WHY this society is split slowly, (and trust me it was at the forefront of my mind constantly), in the end it doesn&#8217;t matter.  Something that started as a way to save the population was grossly mutated in a twisted way to handle and control society.  The book is heavy on French language, which again, I don&#8217;t know why.  I mean, I loved it because it added to the beauty of the book, but I didn&#8217;t really ever know why it was that way.  I understood that the characters family&#8217;s were from French-speaking countries, but I didn&#8217;t really ever get if that was a convenient part of the plot or if this society was heavy in French-speaking because of the alternate universe plot points.Sol&#8217;s commitment to her family is unflinching and even though the book suffers from &#8216;lack of parent syndrome&#8217; (prior to D&#8217;Arcy&#8217;s family coming into the mix at least), we don&#8217;t see a teen who is doing something to combat the society &#8212; she is merely trying to love and protect her family.  There were times, especially in the beginning, where I kept thinking &#8220;What are you doing Sol?&#8221;  She was an incredibly smart teen making incredibly risky choices just for the look of a smile on her blind grandfather who was dying.  And when I thought about that, I realized what kind of character a person like Sol has &#8212; it&#8217;s a bit awe inspiring.  Sure that&#8217;s not to say that her decisions were hasty and half-baked, in a desperate attempt to make that one dream come true, but her heart is something to admire.Even though I love so much about this book, I think in terms of world-building, our explanation of why things are the way they are in this world.  Yes, I got that this alternate universe (which by the way, I LOVE that this society was created from a fixed point in our past &#8212; that this was something that happened to our society because the past, not the future was changed) and that it started at the time of the 1918 flu pandemic, but the WHY of it never really took hold for me.  I think there is a lot of opportunity to explain how the world got stuck this way &#8212; and hopefully we will get to see that in book two and beyond, but it is something that could have made my reading experience less confusing.  I sat for chapters asking these questions and it seriously hindered me from just enjoying the beautiful words on the page. I&#8217;d also like to point out that the 1918 flu pandemic seems to be a frequent topic in the books I&#8217;m reading lately.  I don&#8217;t know why it is a popular point in history with YA, because it never was before I started reading all these books, but it has given me a greater awareness of that point in our history.I loved Fama&#8217;s writing so much.  It is a bit hard to describe how she does it, but she seems to make everything sound beautiful, even when it is ugly.  Even when these awful things are happening in the story, I couldn&#8217;t get over how beautiful the words were.  They made my heart bloom and fall in love &#8212; with the words.  Yes, I fell in love with the words.  Even when I was confused or upset, I was compelled forward into the story because of those words.  And when we finally make it to the romance section of the book, I thought my heart just might burst.  It&#8217;s beautiful and unflinchingly perfect, but doesn&#8217;t overshadow the rest of the book at all.  I also love how Fama gives us bits and pieces of the back story, sprinkled throughout the &#8216;current&#8217; timeline.  It didn&#8217;t seem forced or an easy way to feed us information, but natural as if Sol was sitting in my room recounting her stories of her life.  The inside is as beautiful as the outside and that just made my heart happy.  I also loved the language Fama uses.  There are a lot of great vocabulary words and this book is definitely not &#8216;dumbed&#8217; down in any way.  I have an extensive vocabulary and I still found myself learning some new words.  It&#8217;s smart writing and it doesn&#8217;t wield itself to anything less.Speaking of the romance, I&#8217;m so happy that it is well developed and not insta-love at all.  I mean, the characters practically hate each other, then grow to like, and then love.  It&#8217;s a natural progression.  In dystopian, I tend to see the stress of the world bringing two characters together quickly and intensely, and this one took its time.  Sure, things get intense and passionate, but for some reason, I just thought the timeline worked well and held its own.On another note, this is the second book I&#8217;ve read where the main character forms a relationship with someone she does not know on a school desk.  It&#8217;s such a weird and wonderful idea and I was enamored by it.  Even though I had seen it done with another book written this year, it still made my heart pitter-patter.  I wish I could have found a friend through penciled drawings on a desk in math class.  The only thing I ever found in math class was the notion that I would never, ever, understand proofs.  (Side note, my brain works great in algebra, but geometry is quite literally another language that I will not quite be privy to).Even though I have said a lot in this review, I don&#8217;t think I can properly explain how much awesome was encased in this book&#8217;s insides.  Even with some minor issues, this book blew me away.  I highlighted so many things that when I get a physical copy of it, my book is going to be more yellow highlighter than normal words.For this review and more, visit Such a Novel Idea.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Exquisite", "unixReviewTime": 1398988800, "reviewTime": "05 2, 2014"}

I went in this not sure what to expect; it was steampunk, but it was adult steampunk. I am a YA person, so I was a bit nervous. However, I had faith after reading Open Minds by the same author that Ms. Quinn would come through. And yes she did!First, the setting is so unique, even for a steampunk novel. The blurb is NOT lying when it describes the story as 'steampunk goes to Bollywood.' That is really what it felt like! I haven't read a book with such a cool setting in a long time.Secondly, I loved Ash and Aniri! They were both great characters. Aniri is a main character that you can't help but like; she's brave even when it is hard to be, she's a bit flawed, and she doesn't wait for people to do things for her, she does them herself. Ash has a bit of a Prince Maxon flair &agrave; la the Selection, which is partially why I enjoyed reading about him so much. He is a very enjoyable character as well.The story is NOT predictable, and that's something I just love! No matter if you think you've totally gotten it figured out, you never have until the very end. The author hints something will happen, and then she's like, &#34;Nope, that's not right!

This book had me laughing my head off. Lucy Percy is an heiress and has just come off a betrothal gone awry once her discerning uncle helps her face up to the fact that the gentleman she was engaged to, wanted her only for her money.  Lucy wants to get away from fortune hunters and rusticate for a few months, so she and her widowed aunt decide to rent a cottage in the country. During their time there, the two ladies agree that Lucy will pose as a widow.They rent their cottage from the local Lord, Avedon, who has just managed to get rid of a former renter - a young lady with several children - who was trying to take advantage of his young nephew.  Thinking his nephew will be safe with two widows coming to live in the cottage, he is flummoxed to realize one of the \"widows\" is a young, comely Lucy.Nothing will do Avedon but to get rid of the new tenants - but... Lucy is not easy to get rid of.  All the while, his nephew falls for Lucy and makes a cake of himself, Avedon plunges on in his efforts to get rid of the tenants even going so far as to tear up the road making it impossible for Lucy and her aunt to go or come from the cottage.  Avedon is not prepared for the stubborness he finds in Lucy - she will not leave and the harder he tries to get rid of them, the more determined she is to stay in the cottage.When an additional relative - the somewhat older but still very eligible, handsome, cousin Morton comes into the picture, it seems Avedon begins to realize that he might not want Lucy to leave after all.  But, he still doesn't know what to make of Lucy and first decides that she is not \"as good as she ought to be\" and on a lovely trip to the ocean to one of his properties, offers her carte blanche.  Oh boy, this is where things really get going.  She takes his curricle and heads back home leaving him to make his way back via a borrowed nag and a donkey cart.Once Avedon has realized his mistake, he is done for - at least until he can make a few more mistakes.  During the meantime, his cousin, Morton, is having the time of his life seeing the stiff, conservative Avedon make a \"mud\" cake of himself.  My favorite scene is when Avedon and Bigelow head off to \"rescue\" Lucy from Morton when she is visiting her uncle.  At this point, I was hiding in the bathroom laughing my head off while my husband was sleeping, hoping I wasn't waking him up.Funny, funny book.

Though I groaned at the title, not another Aurora!  This must be the most over used word in SciFi book titles on Amazon. If you read a lot of cheap Kindle editions, it becomes very hard to keep them straight. Seems like every other book has Aurora in the title.  Stop the Madness!Anyway, despite the title, I LOVED the book.  The chapters with the two main characters are simply fantastic.  The chapters without out them do seem to drag on a bit, but they are necessary to build up the political structure that the author then sets on fire and watches it implode.I have to be honest, one of the things I really did enjoy was the incredibly steamy sex scene.  It is so enjoyable to read it from a female author's point of view.  It's so different from all the male oriented crap that fills the cheap Kindle pages.  Here, the author focuses on taste and scent, whereas for a guy, it's usually about looks and feel.  I found the shift in perspective delightful, and the entire episode is so well written, with such vivid intensity and tremendous emotional highs and lows and risks and fears and exquisite joy and anguish.  It's just superb. I even made my wife read it :-)The technology in the book is...appropriate to the story line.  The integrated quantum communications link is sort of taken for granted and not explained (and how can quantum comms be disrupted by a nebula????), but generally, there are no glaring issues, and as stated, it helps establish the story, not subtract from it.  I'm totally in with where she is going on the tech side.I was disappointed in the length of the book.  As the author's first foray into this world of self-publishing, I can see wanting to dip a toe in the waters, but I am hating the trend of never finishing a story line and stringing it out into volume after volume (three in this particular case).  I miss the good old days when an author would write a book, with a beginning, middle, and end.Nonetheless.

Then I googled Boonsboro and discovered that the inn in question exists in \"real life\" and is owned by the author, as is the bookshop.  This use of a novel to promote a business venture would be fine if the story were interesting.  It's not.  The romance is only a side story -- the real story is about all the details relating to the refurbishment of the Inn, and the plans to buy stuff to put in it.  The heroine is perfectly acceptable but seems untouched by her past, the Hero is unbelievably perfect, and there is absolutely no tension in the relationship at all.  No angst, no obstacles in the way, nothing.  At the end I felt as if I'd been manipulated into reading a long ad for the inn.

If I made any connection with any of the characters, it would have to be James. He actually had a compelling &#34;backstory,&#34; and he actually had normal, human feelings, unlike Fia and Annie. For one, Fia really doesn't have a personality. Or if she does, it just describes her as one word&#8212;crazy. She's legitimately crazy. And her sister Annie isn't much better. Annie might not be crazy, but I'm certainly not crazy about her.Right off the bat this book caught my attention, but within 20 pages, it lost it. I thought Adam was going to be an interesting character to read about, but he wasn't present for the majority of the novel. The idea of Fia being trained from a young age to assassinate people and then choose not to assassinate a geeky teenage boy over a dog is ludicrous. (Fia sees Adam petting a dog on the side of the street, and she decides to not kill him. Like what?)Enough about the characters. The world-building/writing is a whole other matter. For one, as a reader you're thrown into the plot unexpectedly. At first, that worked toward the book's advantage, instantly showing the reader action. But as the book went along, the lack of world-building really irritated me. I never really knew what was going on. I picked up on certain aspects of the novel, but it took the entire 237 pages to figure out the majority of the plot. And it took me a good 30-50 pages to figure out that Annie was blind.Also, the writing was enough to get me to groan. Fia did things three times. Three. Freaking. Times. She tap, tap, tapped and pop, pop, popped. Yeah, well, she drove, drove, drove me insane. OH, YES. And Annie had NO REGARD for her sister whatsoever. Annie was always talking/thinking about how she loved her sister, but she didn't really show it. In my mind, Annie was holding Fia back unknowingly.I really don't know what to say about this book, because there really isn't much to say. After 50%, the plot got really slow and somewhat meaningless. I felt like it was a gigantic prologue, especially with the constant flashbacks. I would've been semi-okay with the flashbacks if they actually moved the plot along, but the thing is, the flashbacks did nothing for the novel, which once again lowered my rating for the book.Despite my two star rating, I didn't dislike this book, but I didn't like it either. I don't really have any strong feelings toward it (okay, maybe strong feelings toward snapping Fia's fingers off if she tap, tap, taps them one more time, but that's beside the point); I'm pretty neutral about the whole book. I won an ARC for Perfect Lies, so I'll be reading the next book, but it's not high on my TBR. I wouldn't really recommend this book unless you're looking for a quick read and don't mind not feeling anything for the characters/plot/world-building.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Unrelatable characters", "unixReviewTime": 1397779200, "reviewTime": "04 18, 2014"}

What I like about the book is that Nick has his driver's license and he's not afraid to use it. But turning sixteen isn't what he thought it would be. While other boys his age are worried about prom dates and applying to college, Nick is neck-deep in enemies out to stop him from living another day. No longer sure if he can trust anyone, his only ally seems to be the one person he's been told will ultimately kill him. But life spent serving the undead is anything except ordinary. And those out to get him have summoned an ancient force so powerful even the gods fear it. As Nick learns to command and control the elements, the one he must master in order to combat his latest foe is the one most likely to destroy him. As the old proverb goes, fire knows nothing of mercy, and if Nick is to survive this latest round, he will have to sacrifice a part of himself. However, the best sacrifice is seldom the sanest move. Sometimes it's the one that leaves your enemies confused. And sometimes, you have to trust your enemy to save your friends. But what do you do when that enemy is you?

From Jacob's dream of the heavenly stairway in Genesis 28 to angels visiting Joseph during dreams in Matthew 1 to the Apostle John's &#34;waking dream&#34; from which he obtained the book of Revelation--dreams have been powerful ingredients of God's plan as revealed through Scripture.Fourteen-year-old Archer Keaton discovers he has the ability to enter and explore his dreams. He is a &#34;dreamtreader,&#34; one of three selected from each generation. Their mission: to protect the waking world from the Nightmare Lord, who wreaks chaos in the Dream World. But as Archer's dreams become more dangerous and threatening, so too does his waking life.Rigby Thames, the new kid from England, builds a suspicious rock star-like following at Dresden High School a little too quickly. Even Archer's best friend and confidant, Kara Windchil, seems taken in by the cool guy with the wild blond hair, which definitely rubs Archer the wrong way. Archer must face two foes in two worlds, but he cannot succeed alone. Archer sets off to find other dreamtreaders in a desperate attempt to defeat the enemy terrorizing his friends and family.About the Author:Wayne Thomas Batson is the author of several bestselling novels, including The Door Within trilogy, The Isle series, and The Berinfell series. As a middle school reading teacher, Wayne writes adventures set in imaginative locales because he believes that we all dream of doing something that matters.My Review:Fourteen years of age is really too young to be a hero, but Archer Keaton is a hero, nonetheless. Archer figures out how he can actually enter his dreams, he apparently had always had this ability but just didn't know it. He isn't the only one there are others like him, but not too many---just three from each generation. Archer must protect the world---the waking world from the Nightmare Lord which proves to be harder than one might assume. But soon it seems that his dreams are about to spill over into his daily life and that definitely proves to be very dangerous for him.Archer must find others with the same ability because he can't do this alone---right now its proving to be more than he can handle. So sets of on this journey he does, but his waking world seems to not be going so great either. Especially when a new guy shows up at school and messes everything all up. Because of this Archer decides he isn't too thrilled with Rigby from England and he wonders what all the fuss is about, anyway.**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from my participation in the CSFF Blog Tour.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome Book", "unixReviewTime": 1401408000, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2014"}

This book will rock you to the core, but it is oh so good. I loved every little letter that made up every word in every sentence within the pages of this book. I do not think Courtney Allison Moulton could have wrapped this series up any better. From beginning to end I was hooked. This book turned me into an emotional wreck, but those are the books that always end up being my favorites.Ellie continues to be one of my favorite heroines. She is kickass and strong and nothing ever keeps her down for long. She has to overcome so many different obstacles and she does each and every time. No matter what is thrown at her, I never doubt her ability to persevere. Ellie is a character that is faced with incredibly tough choices, but she always thinks about the greater good and always strives to make the right choice. Some of the choices she makes are not the best for her, but she does it anyway.This book has a lot more Cadan, and I was surprisingly okay with that, which I did not think I would be. His character is very different from when we first met him and I truly enjoyed watching his character change. His character truly fascinates me and I loved the journey his character took. Cadan shows that what you are does not define you, and you can choose to better yourself.Now you are probably thinking; &#8220;Teresa, aren&#8217;t you a crazy Will fan? Why did this review not start off with all sorts of Will rambling?&#8221; Well about that&#8230; Will is left in a very precarious position at the end of Wings of the Wicked and well I simply refuse to let anyone know what happens to him one way or another. You can suffer like I did while reading. I spent a lot of time dying to know what was going to happen to Will one way or the other. I will say this, what you do see of Will is swoony.As I said before, Shadows in the Silence is a great story and it will make your heart hurt. You will truly feel for the characters and become heavily invested in their story. The book will constantly break your heart and it seems as if the poor characters simply cannot catch a break. It seems as if they go from one tragedy to the next. The book will tear you down, only to lift you back up again. I am pretty sure the pages of the book are stained with my tears. I cried so much; I don&#8217;t mean I shed a tear, I mean full on hysterical crying until I couldn&#8217;t see any more tears. I had worries because I read this book right after Finale (sometimes after I read a favorite, the next book pales in comparison), but my worry was misplaced. I loved Shadows in the Silence just as much as I thought I would. I loved taking the journey with these characters and seeing Ellie&#8217;s story come to a conclusion.My absolute favorite thing about this book is that CAM did not take the easy way out. Sacrifices are made and not everyone comes out of this story happy on the other side. She shows that a war like this is not easy and simple; sometimes there are drastic consequences. CAM shows that sometimes sacrifice is necessary for the greater good and that if the person is strong enough, that sacrifice could benefit numerous others. I know this sounds preachy, but this book really does show that, simply by not giving every character a happily ever after. I hate to compare books to Harry Potter, but I am going to with this one, at least in terms of this one aspect. Both authors recognized that when a war like this occurs, some characters will be lost along the way and that things are not always easy. The loss of these characters makes you appreciate the outcome all the more and it makes the situation believable (as much as a paranormal story is ever believable.)To sum it all up, I seriously loved this book and I cannot wait to go back and live it all over again. I am torn because I love the way the series turned out, but now I am devastated that I do not have another book to look forward to. Thankfully we have Madeline and Bastian&#8217;s story to look forward to. CAM did a fabulous job wrapping up this series and I look forward to anything she has in store for us in the future.

One must suspend belief as the improbable  adventures unfold.We first meet the Team in \"Ambush\" a short story set in a Mexican jungle. Their assignment is to rescue captives taken by a drug cartel but they are not helped by a protective jaguar Team Leader Brandt and his team complete their mission against all odds and we learn how Corporal Lopez can drive anything that comes his way. Set for home and well-earned  rest they find themselves sent to the Ecuadorian jungle to transport an attractive lady scientist to Paris.\"30 Pieces of Silver\" starts with us back in 1st century Jerusalem on the eve of The Crucifixion then to modern Paris and a suicide bomber, then that jungle in Ecuador where Dr Rebecca Monroe seems in deep trouble with local Indians. Our Team rescue her but things were not as they seemed. Back to Judea in 14 AD, all most confusing but read on, this is essential to the series. We meet up with some real villains back in the jungle but Rebecca is rescued and flown to Paris. Rest assured all will  eventually be clear.They land in Belgium and only just manage to escape with their lives before arriving in Paris and more troubles as they learn more about a Cult bent on destroying them and events in Judea centuries before, Rebecca and the Team travel to Budapest in search of more clues and we learn about the ancient Jewish community there. There are several cliffhanging crises in Hungary when  they seek for clues that could lead to the remains of Jesus's Disciples. Even those of The Messiah himself but they survive to reach Turkey.and more dramatic actions culminating in the destruction of two important historical monuments, first in a long series of disasters.

Not because the content isn't sad or heart tugging, or graphic, or worthy of it. I just didn't. I think because I knew I was going to read about a life-changing tragedy my brain disconnected from my emotions as a defense mechanism or something. It certainly had nothing to do with the story telling.It's been quite a while since I've reviewed a non-fiction book. I think the last one was Lost in Austen. A very different subject than the tornado that hit Joplin, MO.I found it very helpful to read the two sections at the beginning. They describe how tornadoes work/are formed and how the timeline of the Joplin tornado played out. You may be tempted to skip them thinking, 'I don't need to know that stuff to read the story'. Maybe not, but I'd advise you to read them. They really helped me understand what happened and why people there reacted the ways they did.The 'story' part follows about seven families from before the tornado to after. I had a hard time keeping the families straight, and had to keep referring to the description of family page. Thanks for including that Ms. Heiner or I would've been very lost! But, I think my difficulties had more to do with my brain than the storytelling. These events were given in sequence through interviews with Ms. Heiner so they are all first hand accounts of what happened and then she used her beautiful ability with word craft to put them on the page and bring them larger than life into your imagination.There is also a section at the end that tells you how to get prepared for a tornado and what to do in various scenarios if one should hit where you live. You may be tempted to skip this part too. But, keep this in mind, wherever you live, a natural disaster can occur. Tsunamis, hurricanes, tornadoes, mudslides, wild fires, earthquakes, etc. No one is immune. So, get your 72 hour kit and food storage together, along with all your important docs so you'll be ready. Lots of great info back there.One thing that stood out about the book (SPOILER HERE) none of the families represented lost family members. All are intact at the end of the tornado. I inquired of Ms. Heiner why there was such an obvious imbalance in the stories represented as certainly there were many families who weren't so fortunate. Her response was along the lines of it was too painful to share and they didn't want to risk exploitation. I can appreciate both.Worth a read? Yes. It will wake you up, make you appreciate all you have, and how easily and quickly it can be taken from you.

It not so much bursts from the traps as it does strides confidently from them, looks around, does things in its own time, and then when you're comfortable, it goes for the jugular.It's the tale of an unnamed narrator. He's a university professor, uprooted from an unfulfilling life in England with a wife he doesn't love, and planted back into the soil in Korea, or Seoul to be more specific (Seoul soil?), where he finds himself living an unfulfilling life with a wife he doesn't love, and a 'best friend' he barely knows. He teaches English Literature in a university where a falsified pass rate is infinitely more important than the education of Korea's young.Enter Hana Kim, an 18 year old student with both beauty and intelligence on her side. She approaches our narrator to discuss works of literature, and the pair begin regular meetings to discuss books, and life in general. From here on in he becomes besotted by the girl, initially by what she represents, which is a release from the mundanity of his existence. The longer the book goes on, the more unhinged and dangerous his obsession becomes.So yeah. It's a slow burner, but it's compulsive reading from the off. I had the narrator pegged as a selfish and blinkered fool early on, the way he constantly refers to his Mrs as 'The wife' with a disdain best reserved for enemies, the descriptions of his childhood spattered with venom whenever his over bearing mother is mentioned. He screams out to be shaken, and told to grow up, but I don't think he'd listen. Steve Justice has created a superb character in his narrator, and he fleshes the man out in such an expert manner that it's hard to believe that this is a debut.The bizarre mental justifications for his equally bizarre actions have you clenching your teeth in annoyance, wishing you could 'have a word' with him, to try to shake some sense into his stupid head. Seriously, it's getting me mad just thinking about it. And that, my friends, is one of the many strengths to Steve Justice's writing, he draws a reaction from you. He doesn't just tell you a story, he pulls you in to watch from close up, but without the luxury of being able to do anything about it.So I'd recommend this book any day of the week. The author has created an unhinged anti-hero to rival the best of them.

By the end of the day, Carlee is surprised to learn that the kids love her mom as their teacher.  Carlee realizes having a mom for a teacher isn't so bad and maybe being a teacher is just what she wants to be.I love how there is a story mixed in with the non-fiction parts of the book.  It is kind of a fiction/non-fiction book. We learn factual information about real people as Carlee travels through her day. Carlee's story is realistic enough for kids to identify with her fears, hesitations and excitement on her first day.  As someone who works in our children's school, I know the embarrassment and excitement that our children feel when I am in the building.Our 9-year old read this book and enjoyed it.  She liked reading the quotes and information about real people.  She liked Carlee's character and all the jobs she considered being.  Our daughter also wants to be a teacher (as of today) and this book reinforced that for her.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Great Fiction/Factual Series for Kids", "unixReviewTime": 1391731200, "reviewTime": "02 7, 2014"}

So it was just a ruse to put two people together. Once established as a lover of literature, Meghan never talks about it until she mentions &#34;Moby Dick,&#34; and that doesn't move much. Once she got to college, NOTHING is said about it until she's meeting some people - but NOTHING is said about what might excite her in the classroom, the books she reads, the professors, nothing until a conversation until she's supposed to be drunk in the scene toward the end - simply a device again. Also, little thought was given to the pressures of her work/school situation - being a waitress is hard work, but here it seems a device just to get her to meet ol' Grey, who has to rescue her from herself (sigh). The motivation for a key scene was also missing, which seemed like sloppy editing, but I won't go into it here. The actual writing sounded as if Macomber had never read Shakespeare or Spenser or &#8230;anyone but other Harlequin writers.Meghan was simply unbelievable - she spoke with too much formal language (this could have been an interesting device with the character being criticized for her style of speech, but Macomber seems completely unaware of this). Grey's character is also, in the end, not credible. It's all &#34;romantic realism&#34; in the worst sense, just going for the scene payoffs without any relationship with reality. The characters meet, have second thoughts, break up, have misunderstandings, oh yawn.I wish it had worked. It was a nice idea. It's a cause of some despair that the readers don't seem to require much effort on the part of Ms. Macomber, who can certainly do better than this. She gave herself such opportunities to do something quite interesting here, but failed to do anything at all for anyone. So it was not my thing - it asked nothing of me and gave no insight into any characters at all. Macomber just seems to be rolling this one out for some not very demanding readers. Wow.

Harvey, who was active as a major league umpire from 1962 &#8211; 1992, has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame, and been voted the second best umpire, behind Bill Klem, of all time. The book is filled with Harvey's assessment of ball players, managers, and fellow umpires based largely on their deportment on and off the field as well as the degree to which they easily bent themselves to his enormous will and sense of himself. Players and managers who learned not to argue or to do so according to Harvey's set of rules come off looking pretty good, while those who gave him a great deal of difficulty are hammered. Similarly, umpires who bent to his or agreed with his standards for umpiring come across as being good officials, although none but a couple of his mentors ever measure up to him. Harvey's egotism and his sense of his own correctness dominate the book. He frequently asserts his fairness and his willingness not to carry grudges, while his stories emphasize the cost to players, managers, and the game of his propensity to get even. I'm unsure whether these marked contrasts represent his lack of self-awareness or the depth of his hypocrisy.Doug Harvey grew up in the poverty of the Imperial Valley of California during the great depression. His father worked hard to maintain a hard-scrabble existence. Young Doug often went with him as he umpired amateur and minor league games, while excelling in athletics himself. He was sometimes asked to serve as an umpire, earning small amounts of money doing so. He attended college on an athletic scholarship, but was unable to finish due to an injury and early, doomed marriage. He always worked hard, and, with increasing frequency umpired baseball and refereed basketball, at the college and minor league level, eventually rising to higher levels as his first marriage dissolved. Eventually, he rose to the major leagues after several years umpiring in Mexico and Puerto Rico as well as the AAA California League  league. He became a major league umpire in 1962, jumping  over several senior hopefuls as one of the last umpires not to attend umpire school. Read the rest of this review on my blog.

He is attracted to Jane&#8217;s and Elizabeth&#8217;s beauty and Charlotte&#8217;s agreeable nature, but he completely overlooks plain Mary, who, with her preference of sermons, serious nature, and fondness for counseling others, would perhaps be the ideal candidate. I&#8217;ve always wondered if Mr. Collins ever thought of Mary Bennet, if he even noticed her. Did he see their compatibility and ignore it? In Jack Caldwell&#8217;s newest novel he explores what happens when Mr. Collin&#8217;s sees Mary and proposes to her instead of Elizabeth&#8230;So how does Mary marrying Mr. Collins change the story for the other characters, you ask? Well, the Netherfield party still departs to London, but because her sister is soon to be married, Jane Bennet doesn&#8217;t venture there herself. She instead accompanies Elizabeth on a long visit to Hunsford Parsonage (that&#8217;s right, no Maria Lucas!). Where we learn that Mary and Anne de Bourgh don&#8217;t remain indifferent acquaintances with each other, but instead become fast friends.What I loved most about this story was seeing all the positive results of Mr. Collins&#8217;s marriage to Mary! Mary&#8217;s development and improvement was wonderful to witness; she handles Mr. Collins masterfully and truly comes into her own. And now that the sisters are separated by a distance of &#8220;nearly fifty miles,&#8221; they seem to value each other more and their increased sisterly affection for each other was heartwarming to observe. In addition, I loved how Mary, while respectful and kind towards Lady Catherine, did not worship her with the same absolute veneration that her husband is prone to do and often steered him in a better direction than his &#8220;esteemed patroness.&#8221; Go Mary!Mary&#8217;s maturity and development isn&#8217;t the only pleasing one to witness in this tale, Anne de Bourgh, while under the guidance and support of her new friend is finally becoming the woman she has always longed to be. Taking secret music lessons, driving carriages, interfering with her cousin&#8217;s relationship, trying to attract a certain suitor&#8230;I liked seeing Anne take a more active part in the plot!While I loved the premise of this variation and enjoyed seeing the changes it wrought, I did often wish that the story deviated a little more. There were a lot of familiar scenes and similar conversations, and it seemed like Mary marrying Mr. Collins had more impact on Jane and Bingley then it did Darcy and Elizabeth. (Loved how Jane handled Mr. Bingley! Go Jane!) The course of Darcy and Elizabeth&#8217;s relationship seemed to be the same, even with the help of Darcy&#8217;s well-meaning cousins and Elizabeth&#8217;s matchmaking sister. I found myself enjoying the Jane/Bingley relationship in this story more than the Darcy/Elizabeth one, especially when Elizabeth makes a brazen and assumptive declaration to Mr. Darcy&#8230;(that just felt odd.)Part of me wished this variation stayed with and focused on Mary, Anne, and Jane, but you can&#8217;t have a Pride and Prejudice variation without Darcy and Elizabeth!!

Had I not already been swamped with a line-up of collections and anthologies to read at the time, I would have added this one to the pile sooner. Now, having read it, I see that I should have made it a priority.Dark Forces is not only a truly entertaining book from front to back, but serves as a valuable time capsule for its time, having been published in the very early 80s it manages to show how some of the then up-and-comers fared alongside some true legends in the horror genre.Right off the bat, the book gave me the chance to revisit Stephen King's The Mist, which is the very last story and the one I immediately jumped to. I don't often re-read books, but for this gem of a tale I'd make an exception. Honestly, if you haven't read The Mist yet, then do yourself a favor and just go buy this anthology. It'll be worth the pricetag for that one novella alone.Ramsey Campbell's &#34;The Brood&#34; reminded me that I need to pick up one of the novels I have of his sitting on my bookshelf and get to reading his work again. The guy is a wee bit amazing with the tales of terror. Robert Bloch's &#34;The Night Before Christmas&#34; on the other hand was a bit of a letdown, though not because it was poorly written--quite the opposite--but the author of Psycho felt a bit too clever in this one. Then Charles L. Grant's &#34;A Garden of Black  Red Roses&#34; offered a really great glimpse of a guy whose work I need to get to know, as he deftly spins a quiet, smalltown horror story here. Joyce Carol Oates is another writer with a skilled hand at disquieting stories, and &#34;The Bingo Master&#34; manages to do just that, though it's one of the few tales I felt took a good long while in getting warmed up.It's been nearly thirty-five years since Dark Forces originally came out--nearly ten since Cemetery Dance republished it for an anniversary edition here--and there are times while reading that it does feel dated. Not out-dated, mind you, but there is a kind of nostalgic kick that comes with reading some of these stories. Or mayne it's just the brand of new horror that I've been reading with a harder, slightly meaner tone, which has me seeing this book with a rose-colored hue. In any case, I wholly recommend it to horror readers who have yet to give it a try, especially those who maybe have only read recent works lately.

Cristopher Jansma shows how its done in The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards. This debut novel, now available in paperback, follows the worldwide travels of the ultimate unreliable narrator. It&#8217;s like ten books in one &#8211; a Southern coming of age story, an academic farce, a New York excursion and an expat&#8217;s tall tale &#8211; propelled forward by neatly contained chapters (which are like stories within stories). The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards is compulsively readable, filled with oddball characters, strange situations and sudden turns of fate, all told by a sort of Nick Carroway, looking on enviously at the Gatsbys all around him.My only criticism: The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards switches scenes too quickly. Plot threads are picked up and dropped. Sometimes, you want to know more about that couple in Dubai. You want more &#8211; a good sign in a novel.Ultimately, The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards is a book about stories, the ones that are true, and the ones we tell ourselves. &#8220;Tell all the truth, but tell it slant,&#8221; Emily Dickinson says, a mantra that runs throughout this novel. With their ability to tell it slant, novels contain truths that you won&#8217;t find in the newspaper.The Unchangeable Spots of Leopards demonstrates the power of literary fiction to provide enlightenment through entertainment. Great storytelling is a kind of trick, an ancient one that we&#8217;re programmed to enjoy. Like listening to some stranger&#8217;s shaggy dog tale, we know that what we&#8217;re hearing is not technically true. But we have to know how it ends. Great literary fiction is like that, wrapping us up in an engaging story that tells it slant.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Tell It Slant", "unixReviewTime": 1393286400, "reviewTime": "02 25, 2014"}

Thanks to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, and countless numbers of professional and personal blogs, there&#8217;s very little information that&#8217;s truly kept private these days. Sonogram pictures, marital discord, gastrointestinal distress, vacation brags, shopping preferences&#8230;you name it and surely it&#8217;s been made public by someone. Of course, individuals have some control over what information is shared with their adoring public. Only the neediest, most narcissistic of us over share every part of our lives. But what if the choice was taken away from us? What if complete and total participation in all manners of social networking was not optional but entirely mandatory? What if every facet of your life was filtered through and controlled by one monopolistic Internet company? This frighteningly foreseeable book by Dave Eggers proposes just that.Mae can&#8217;t believe her luck when she lands her dream job at The Circle, a tech company best described as Google on steroids. Its reach is all-encompassing, and Mae quickly finds herself brainwashed by the Utopian atmosphere all around her. The company embeds itself in users&#8217; lives by linking and making public every aspect of their online existence: social networks, medical history, banking and financial history, and social life. Their ultimate goal is total transparency consisting of people always being tracked and monitored and public access cameras placed everywhere. While there are clearly many benefits to this type of tracking, specifically safety issues, Mae is too enamored with her fame and status within the company to see the negative implications. She becomes increasingly distanced from her family and friends outside of the company even as they try to warn her of the dangers of such total dominance proposed by The Circle.I was very intrigued by the concept of this book. It seems like something that&#8217;s not too far off the mark from where some of us are at right now with our reliance on technology, social media in particular. There&#8217;s an inherent danger in relying on others to validate your sense of self-worth, especially in an online world. And we&#8217;ve all read about and seen the negative effects of too much screen time at the expense of spending time in the real world. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m as guilty as the next person of wasting too much time on Facebook on occasion. And I&#8217;ve met many wonderful people online who I now consider to be dear friends. But the real danger comes when we look to a non-living entity such as a computer, tablet, or smartphone to make us feel good about ourselves. There&#8217;s no piece of technology that can truly do that. This is an excellent book, if for nothing else to act as a warning of the direction we may be headed.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Far too believable!", "unixReviewTime": 1404172800, "reviewTime": "07 1, 2014"}

I like that I can keep up with some distant friends and family this way, but it's mostly just noise, at best meaningless, at worst it makes me dissatisfied and/or angry (I know that during the Charleston area's recent and continuing water crisis Facebook began as a great place to exchange information, but has now gotten to the point that my husband begs me not to look at it). I also resent all the time I waste reading about things I don't really care about and there is so much pressure to keep up. Anyway, a perfect topic for a writer like Eggers to take on and while I know a lot of people were underwhelmed by the book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it - a solid 4.5 stars, even though it made me want to immediately go off the grid and pay only cash for items.Mae is over-educated and under-employed. Her college roommate, Annie manages to get her a job with her company, The Circle similar to Facebook only much bigger and encompassing more of everyday life (though the campus seems to have been modeled on Microsoft's) - \"the company had so much going on, so much humanity and good feeling, and was pioneering on all fronts, that she knew she was being improved just by being in the Circlers' proximity. It was like a well-curated organic grocery store: you knew, by shopping there, that you were healthier; you couldn't make a bad choice, because everything had been vetted already.\" (105)Mae becomes more and more enmeshed in life at (and in) the Circle, to the point in ruins most relationships she had prior to her new job. Her father is suffering from MS (one of the most successful parts of the books, I thought) and Mae's new job is, initially, a boon, but then becomes something darker for her family and old friends. In a conversation with her old boyfriend he notes, \"'listen, twenty years ago, it wasn't so cool to have a calculator watch, right? And spending all day inside playing with your calculator watch sent a clear message that you weren't doing so well socially. And judgments like 'like' and 'dislike' and 'smiles' and 'frowns' were limited to junior high. Someone would write a note and it would say, 'Do you like unicorns and stickers?' and you'd say, 'Yeah, I like unicorns and stickers! Smile!' That kind of thing. But now it's not just junior high kids who do it, it's everyone, and it seems to me sometimes I've entered some inverted zone, some mirror world where the dorkiest s*** in the world is completely dominant. The world has dorkified itself.'\". (133) Separate from the larger social issues Eggers does a good job showing how annoying it can all become (the issues with Alistair and the pushiness of total strangers rang very true). Though the last third of the book relied a bit heavily on 1984 and the aquarium section was a bit overwhelming, the end was both inevitable and incredibly interesting.Most readers will have no doubt about the big secret or be very surprised about the progression of the action, but even though much of what occurred was expected Eggers uses his gift for dialogue and creation of real characters (who of us hasn't been incredibly envious of friends, annoyed with parents or dated a person he/she didn't really care about?) to overcome the lack of suspense and did a great job showing how insidiously easy it can be to head down the slope.

I thought of The Geography of You and Me as the book that would decide whether I ever read a Jennifer E. Smith book again. I liked The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight, I thought it was a solid read with a fun premise and I happily gave it three stars. This is What Happy Looks Like did not make me happy, in fact, it made me very unhappy and made my list of the worst books of 2013. But The Geography of You and Me snuck up on me and really charmed me.What made the story work for me? If I had to pick one thing I would say Lucy. I fell for Lucy head over heels. She&#8217;s a quiet, shy, sweet 16-year-old who lives in New York City. When the story starts her older twin brothers, really her only friends, have just left for college and her parents are jet-setting around Europe (their typical MO). I&#8217;ll admit I found Lucy&#8217;s friendlessness and isolation a little odd, but still, there was something about the way Jennifer E. Smith wrote her story that clicked with me and allowed me to really relate to Lucy.Lucy is riding the elevator back up to her apartment when the building, and the entire east coast, loses power. I wasn&#8217;t living in NYC during the 2003 blackout, but I did lose power on Long Island, where I was living, and even though it was really annoying I also remember it being really fun. Trapped in the elevator with Lucy is Owen, the new superintendent&#8217;s son who is on his way to the building&#8217;s roof. Owen&#8217;s mother has just passed away and he and his father moved to NYC in the hopes of starting over both personally and professionally, but Owen hates the noise and hustle and bustle of the city and longs to see the stars at night.The book&#8217;s description says that Lucy and Owen explore the city, but that&#8217;s not quite what happens. When they are freed from the elevator they head to Lucy&#8217;s apartment, they check out the neighborhood, get water and ice cream, and then spend the night on the building&#8217;s roof, where it&#8217;s cooler and Owen can finally see the stars. The next morning the spell is broken and Owen is gone and Lucy goes back to her normal life. That is until her parents suddenly decide to fly her over to Europe and then tell her they might be moving to London. Lucy&#8217;s family ends up moving to Edinburgh and Owen and his father leave to NYC to head out west.Lucy and Owen do keep in touch, and Jennifer E. Smith draws parallels between what each of them is doing on different continents, but, even though they send each other the occasional postcard and think of each other often, they&#8217;re living very separate, different lives. Lucy&#8217;s family is very wealthy and they live in a nice house in Edinburgh and she goes to a fancy school (where she makes friends and meets a cute boy) and they travel all over Europe. Owen and his father, on the other hand, are barely making ends meet, moving from place to place to try to find work for his dad. Even though their very different financial situations were never mentioned I really liked how Jennifer E. Smith subtly wove them into the story.One of the things that drove me nuts about This is What Happy Looks Like was the incredibly awkward third-person narrative. At the New York City Teen Author Fest Jennifer E. Smith talked about how she always writes in third-person and I don&#8217;t remember it about The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight so it must not have bothered me. In the case of The Geography of You and Me the third-person narrative really worked, it&#8217;s part of what made it so charming to me and was probably the most pleasant surprise about reading this story.A friend, someone I used to work with and the person who leant me this ARC, told me that she liked this book, but felt like it had every recent YA cliche. I&#8217;ll admit I hadn&#8217;t thought about that before, but after she said it I gave it some thought and I don&#8217;t disagree with her. There&#8217;s the whole one-night, instant connection thing; the postcards and emails that they write back and forth; the kind of fairytale feel to the story; and the travel, both domestic and international that&#8217;s woven into Lucy and Owen&#8217;s lives. I debated whether I thought I should hold that against Jennifer E. Smith, but in the end I decided not to. Is there glory to be had in writing an interesting, entertaining book with story elements that aren&#8217;t currently in vogue? I don&#8217;t think that makes it better. Is there glory in writing an interesting, entertaining book with story elements that are currently in vogue? I would say so.Bottom Line: After liking and disliking Jennifer E. Smith&#8217;s previous two most recent books I was pleasantly surprised by The Geography of You and Me and really fell for the Lucy character. If you&#8217;re like me and were disappointed by This is What Happy Looks Like give Smith another shot, I&#8217;m glad I did. I liked this so much that I actually looked into Smith&#8217;s earlier books and I&#8217;m considering giving some of them a read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Best of Jennifer E Smith", "unixReviewTime": 1397520000, "reviewTime": "04 15, 2014"}

Let me elaborate why:*** Minor spoilers follow ***First of all most of the interesting things are revealed except for the enemy who we can deduce is also Human as a species so most of the air is out of the balloon. Characters start surviving magically and although this is not exaggerated to the point of hilariousness situations which arise from this will sometimes feel a bit contrived. Also the fact that genetic treatment is almost instant and is utterly destructive when activated was a bit too hard for me to believe. How can genetic treatment undo brain wiring almost instantly, I would have expected the effects to be most noticeable in the next generation rather than the current one but I guess a tension point that was kind of relevant to the plot would not have existed if it would have gone my way.*** Minor spoilers end ***The author manages to create some interesting plot twists, the characters are already fleshed out but the twist in personality they experience to me wasn't believable or consistent, they sometimes seem bipolar.Also the author seemed to just mention some interesting situations, briefly detailing a (moral) choice that might have dire repercussions but never elaborates on the effects that might have had on the character or the world.Overall this second installment of the series does not seem so well fleshed out as the first one, it falls short of greatness but it's still an enjoyable quick read. I will finish the series despite the reviews which make it clear that problems foreshadowed in this second book will only be made worse in the third.I still liked this story a lot and some of the concepts, some of the events seemed a bit forced but it did not impact my overall enjoyment. I still feel I can't rate this book a maximum of five stars because it falls short of other works which do science fiction a bit better.I wish the author would have spent more time on the details, did more research and fine tuned the events a bit.

I was not disappointed with Crossed but I do think Matched was better. I&#8217;ve read really mixed reviews on this sequel and I can see why. Personally I enjoyed this story and am looking forward to the final book in the trilogy.Crossed was definitely more character driven instead of plot driven. The writing is very poetic and beautiful but that also makes it slow in places. There just really is not a lot that happens in this story. My husband asked me about one of the books I read recently and there was no way I could have even begun to summarize it unless he has 10 or 15 minutes to listen to me. By contrast I could sum up what happened in this book in about a minute. Yes I&#8217;d be leave out a lot of back-story and details about characters but as far as plot-line for this book there just isn&#8217;t much that happens. That said I really did enjoyed this book. I liked learning more about the characters and the society.Usually in a book that has a love triangle I have a strong opinion on who the main characters should end up with. I don&#8217;t have that with this book. I&#8217;m open to Cassia ending up with either Ky or Xander.I really think the third book has potential to be the best in the series.

This is a pity as the author appears to have spent a lot of time in researching his subject matter. The gory descriptions of Comanche torture are sadistic and formulaic adding little to anything.

But to always frame the temptation as a long-term vs short-term question.There are also a number of different justifications that we always tell ourselves, such as &#34;I ran 4 miles today so I deserve a piece of chocolate cake&#34;... The author actually goes through a number of these one by one - and it's interesting because I am guilty of many if not all of these from time to time.  The author explains why each one of these rationalizations sabotage our long-term interests.  The first step is being aware, and the author does a good job bringing visibility to the most common rationalizations of failing willpower challenges.The two activities that have been shown time and time again to increase willpower and overall happiness in life across numerous studies are exercise and meditation.One other part of the book I enjoyed was where the author got into the dichotomy between our 'future selves' and our 'present selves'.  When we think about ourself in the future, we imagine some perfect version of ourselves free of stress and anxiety with more free time and with that version of ourself actually progessing towards our goals.  In reality though, there's no reason why our future self would be any less stressed out or anxious, or would go running 5 miles a day per say, if we're not doing those things now.The author makes an interesting point that your *current* activities define your future self, which seems obvious but is not.  So if you imagine your future self to be living a particular lifestyle or achieving some lofty goals, you need to be taking direct steps towards those things now and not also at some point in the future.Overall this was a great book, I'd highly recommend to anyone.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Excellent book", "unixReviewTime": 1400889600, "reviewTime": "05 24, 2014"}

Who can resist a broken war hero and an insecure woman with trust issues that have smoking hot chemistry? I know I certainly can&#8217;t. I really liked Nate and Lilly from the start. Lilly is ridiculously feisty and has a giant chip on her shoulder where Nate is concerned and rightfully so. The banter between these two is spectacular and really amped things up in the story. The sexual chemistry is also off the charts, even when I was feeling so bad for Lilly because Nate was a jerkface.Nicolette Day does an amazing job of delving into both Nate and Lilly&#8217;s issues. Nate is really broken to the point of feeling guilty for being alive. Lilly&#8217;s mother did a number on her, leaving her afraid of being abandoned again and not trusting those around her. The way feelings grow between these two is great and I loved watching them both start to deal with their deep seated problems. Of course they all weren&#8217;t figured out overnight, but they weren&#8217;t just swept under the rug either.I look forward to reading more by Nicolette.

{"reviewerID": "A13DHT9IJA4J13", "asin": "1497436826", "reviewerName": "A Book Vacation", "helpful": [1, 1], "reviewText": "This is an interesting look at the fountain of youth myth that has followed mankind since its conception. No one wants to grow old and die, and the idea of an element that can stop death in its tracks is indeed a great one. Imagine if there were a crystal that, through bathing in its light could restore your youth to you for all eternity? Now, imagine shadow creatures who are forever searching for this crystal, wishing to become human, who will stop at nothing to obtain it? Intriguing, right? It is, and I really enjoyed this aspect of the novel, though I would have loved more of the story to be devoted to these two elements. As the novel stands, we are given glimpses of these entities, but their presence is more or less felt but not seen. Hence, I am hoping that more comes of them in the second novel in the series.While I liked this novel overall, I will admit that there are a vast number of similarities between it and Twilight/New Moon, which I have to say lessoned a bit of the fun of this novel because the story itself was not necessarily unique in this aspect. The instant attraction between Emily and Theo, the underlying secret kept, Emily&#8217;s curiosity and sleuthing, the near fatal accident that puts it all in perspective for her, and the appearance of the three Guardians and their ultimatum are just a few of the many similarities that brought Meyer&#8217;s novels to the mind. In turn, this made it hard for me to really focus on Blue Moon because my mind continued to assess similarities while I read.I&#8217;ve read many books that are similar to others in this respect, but depending on the storyline and the differences, it&#8217;s either easily overlooked on my part, or impossible to ignore. I&#8217;m sorry to say that in this instance, I had a hard time ignoring the similarities and focusing on the originality, but do note that originality is indeed there. Spence adds in elements of horror, though not horror in the way that I usually think of it&#8212;there is no blood and guts strewn about&#8212;but there is a darkness that follows the story, giving it small elements of horror in a more suspenseful manner, such as the shadow creatures.I really enjoyed the introduction of the shadow creatures, the shape shifters, and the crystal itself, and I would have loved the novel to give a more intensive look at all these aspects instead of focusing so much on Emily, who is indeed a very aggravating character. But even so, Spence has created the perfect workings for her next novel should she choose to pursue the shadow creature angle.In regard to Emily, well, she is not my favorite, which is unfortunate, but understandable. Emily and I are two completely different people, and whereas she acts and defies those around her, I tend to listen to reason and observe from the sidelines. Her intense desire to know everything that is happening around her puts her into situations that I found to have been avoidable had she thought more clearly before acting, but even so, she is not me. And though I do not agree with many of her choices throughout the novel, she is still a very real representation of rash, curious people, and although I personally didn&#8217;t like her, Spence did a great job making her a valid character.Theo is perhaps my favorite of the novel. Intent on keeping Emily safe, though cryptic in his explanations, he has a good heart and will do anything for her and his family in order to keep them all safe. He, like Emily, is driven by passion more than reason, and yet it works for him&#8230; perhaps I dislike Emily so much because I am jealous?The novel is told in first person from Emily&#8217;s viewpoint, but occasionally switches to third person in a few chapters as outside elements unfold&#8212;those Emily is not privy to. It was a bit jarring at first, but as the novel progressed, I found that it worked well and that I thoroughly enjoyed this style. First person narration is in fact my favorite narration, but in order to get all the information concerning events unfolding, third person was needed, and I think that was a great choice on Spence&#8217;s part.Overall, this is a good story that looks at the depths people are willing to go to procure beauty.(Please note: I use the rating system of Goodreads, which is different from Amazon.  My overall rating is that I liked it.)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting Look at the Depths People are Willing to go to Procure Beauty", "unixReviewTime": 1396137600, "reviewTime": "03 30, 2014"}

Hot guys (yes there are multiple)....absolutely.  Love triangle....yep.  All of that rolled into one book equals &#34;Tag Chaser&#34; by Kandi Steiner.  Paisley doesn't let very many people in...in fact she can count the people close to her on two fingers and one of them is her very hot guy best friend Tanner.  After being hurt in the past she decides to date only military men because they eventually leave and she can move on with no commitment needed.  When her other best friend Mackenzie makes her bet that she can't give up her &#34;tag chasing&#34; ways and date a regular guy, Paisley rises to the challenge and decides that it's time for a change.  Enter Corbin Ray, a guy who makes her reevaluate all the walls she keeps around herself.  Will the secrets they are each keeping from one another threaten the relationship they are building?  When Paisley has to choose between the two guys fighting for her heart will she choose the easy path or the one that challenges her to be more than she ever thought she could be?  Click buy now and find out as you sink your teeth into the pages of this moving and sexy story!I love Tanner!  I may be in the minority here but he just hit all the right notes for me!  He is sexy, just the right amount of cocky, and willing to do anything for Paisley.  I love that he is so into music and I really identified with him seeing his life through lyrics.  Every girl should have a Tanner waiting on them at home and I was seriously jealous of Paisley and frustrated at her inability to see what was right in front of her.  The second book in this series focuses on Tanner and I couldn't pick it up fast enough as soon as I finished this one.Paisley is really like a little girl lost.  Disappointed by her dad, she has lost her faith in the male species (with the exception of Tanner).  She's a bit like a shell of a person just going through the motions of life hoping nothing will penetrate the thick walls she surrounds herself in.  I love her banter with Tanner...they have a natural connection that flows effortlessly off the page.  The attraction and the chemistry are there as well which makes the love triangle all that much more realistic when you throw Corbin into the mix.  I liked watching her journey of self-discovery brought on by her growing relationship with Corbin.  It was cool seeing her find herself as she found him.Corbin is just as hot as Tanner and an all around great guy.  I like that Steiner doesn't make either guy a jerk but instead allows you to invest in each one differently.  He, too, has suffered hurt in the past and is coming into himself along with Paisley.  They bring about healing in each other and it gives their story a nice quiet beauty.Steiner's style is very fluid.  She chooses to focus on the heart of her characters and that makes them all the more realistic.  Her character development is spot on and sets up these characters to move on past one book.  I am fully invested in this series and am already halfway through book two.  I can't wait to see where these character's roads lead.  This is a definite one to recommend.

{"reviewerID": "ASQW8Y9DY6LM6", "asin": "B00J5OU43U", "reviewerName": "Glynn Young", "helpful": [8, 9], "reviewText": "Mavis Doriel Hay wrote only three mystery novels, during the period known as the Golden Age of Mystery. Her first, &#8220;Murder Underground,&#8221; was published in 1934, when writers like Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers were already household names. It was followed by &#8220;Death on the Cherwell&#8221; (1935), set in Oxford, and &#8220;The Santa Klaus Murder&#8221; (1936), set at an English country estate. Hay continued to write, but after her third mystery, she turned to the subject of rural crafts, which she dearly loved.Hay was largely forgotten until last year, when the British Library began republishing a number of mystery novels printed during the Golden Age (like John Bude&#8217;s &#8220;The Cornish Coast Murder&#8221; and &#8220;The Lake District Murde&#8221;r). All three of Hay&#8217;s mystery novels are now available in both paperback and ebook versions.Murder Underground is set in north London, near Hampstead Heath, and it is a combination of improbable, bewildering and great fun.Miss Euphemia Pongleton (only a British writer would invent that name), a rather elderly resident of the respectable Frampton Private Hotel, sails forth one morning for a dentist appointment. She passes the closest tube station to save on fare, and arrives at the Belsize Park Station. Because of her fear of elevators, she decides to walk down the 220-step staircase. Along the way, someone strangles her with a dog leash &#8211; the leash for her own dog, taken from where it usually hung in the hotel entrance way.Miss Pongleton wasn&#8217;t a particularly nice character, and there are no end of suspects, including residents of the hotel and her relatives. And the suspects rather cheerfully go about suppressing evidence, changing evidence, omitting facts, and conveniently not remembering, to the extent that it becomes difficult to keep track of who was actually where, who did what, and who said what. The police inspector seems to be outsmarted and outmaneuvered at almost every turn. And several of the characters/suspects decide to do some sleuthing and investigating on their own, all for the very best of reasons (and one, of course, for the very worst).Is &#8220;Murder Underground&#8221;one of the great mystery stories?  No, but then no one is making that claim. It is representative of its period; there were numerous writers in both Britain and America during the Golden Age of mysteries, and most are largely forgotten.It includes diagrams of some of the scenes; I can&#8217;t explain why I&#8217;ve always loved diagrams in mystery stories, but I do. It does require a closer reading than one might expect with a mystery story, if nothing else than to keep track of how the characters try to screw things up.But it is a fun read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Improbable, Bewildering and Great Fun", "unixReviewTime": 1400198400, "reviewTime": "05 16, 2014"}

The gorgeous cover, the intriguing title, the captivating blurb and an interesting prologue that will make you crave for answers. Christine Brae&#8217;s previous books have been on top of my list for 2013 great reads, but could she do it again?&#34;Closing Doors. Is that what my life has been about? Is that why I am now doing the complete opposite? Opening them. Rebelling against life's best plaid plans? Living with the need to break free? But what is it that I'm running away from? What am I searching for?&#34;And for the 3rd time around, Christine Brae did not disappoint. Insipid has all the elements I like about her books. The romance, the challenging friendships and the integration of family life. The importance of these situations were balanced so nicely with delightful details and endings you wouldn&#8217;t have completely expected. The book is very organized and was very sure of its own identity even until the very end.Insipid is a great story of two people who need and seek isolation so that they may heal their old wounds but serendipitously end up falling love with each other. I really rooted for these two as I warmed up to both of them. It is beautiful!This story starts out with a great deal of sadness. Two young lovers looking forward to the rest of their lives crash and burn due to social status and differences. Jade, with a very sheltered life, and Chris struggling to have a successful career in basketball but never really had the chance to fulfill it. There are many flashbacks to the young couple&#8217;s fresh and vibrant life together which intermixed very well with the kind of life they had after the fall out. Much to my surprise and delight, there is a fascinating and intriguing mystery that kind of turns the story upside-down.Trying to move on with her bitter past, Jade, tries to live a normal life. Dedicating most of her time to her career, where she met the man who unexpectedly brought back the color in her life, Lucas.Despite of what he has become, Lucas did some stupid things in the past when the last girl almost broke him in more ways than one. But something happens that brings about an enormous change in his life. Lucas is determined to get closer to Jade, though the path to get there ain&#8217;t easy, he has the patience and strong will to stick it out. Maybe it&#8217;s the fact that he finds Jade so mysterious. Maybe because he sees her as someone so strong yet so breakable. Maybe because he feels that Jade needs him, and Lucas needs to be needed. Whatever it is, I loved watching their romance develop slowly.Insipid is a very quiet, gentle story that perfectly reflects not only Lucas and Jade&#8217;s characters but their slow struggle back toward life. There are many unforeseen obstacles with which they have to deal with, but in the end, truth and love prevail. It&#8217;s about hope and forgiveness. A loving story that truly allows two people who have been shattered for somewhat different reasons to heal, to blend, and to meld beautifully. Fantastic!&#34;The past. Sometimes, we get so hung up about it that it prevents us from looking ahead.Let the past go. Step forward no matter how much more comfortable you are with your past.Trust in your heart because it places its trust in you.&#34;If you like to read books with an emotional, meaningful story, with lots of character growth, twists and turns, and important life lessons, then give this one a go!Thanks to Ms. Brae for letting me be part of Lucas and Jade's journey.

I was not disappointed when I was gifted a copy from Arden Aoide ( HUGE thanks to you lady I want MORE now!!) Every Girl dreams of her wedding and wants to look her best, not Shula she wanted to show everyone how much she didn't want this wedding. See arranged marriages would be hard for anyone but knowing that your mother killed herself to save you from this arranged marriage really makes you not want it. Shula goes the extreme to show it why should she care, she plans on killing herself. But then at the wedding something happens and it makes the arranged marriage more tolerable. I am sucked into this world, it had to beginning of love, resent, plotting and murder it in. I can't wait to see whats next and what it was Shula's mother knew. I just know there's a lot of this story that had to deal with what she knew and why she killed herself. I believe fans of Arden's fans will not be disappointed in A Consummation. But I believe this will bring her more fans, and I am very excited to see where this series will take her.I was very lucky to be gifted with a copy for this review.

She knows exactly what she wants and it is the Earl of Hawkhurst who catches her entire  being.  Skye just knows they are meant to be together and she sees beyond his outward scars and realizes he needs her just as much as she needs him.  She must be smart about her plans to catch him though; she knows he is almost betrothed so her desire to be his bride must stay hidden.Lady Skye does hatch a very good plan so they can spend time together, she needs someone to help find her uncle&#8217;s long lost love.  Since Hawk is a member of the Guardian of the Swords, he has unique contacts and abilities and he is the perfect person to find the missing woman.Hawk is a noble and above all loyal hero.  He has a duty to the Guardians and he is very willing to marry the Guardian Master&#8217;s chosen bride since he has no desire to experience love again.  His wife and child were killed by a fire years earlier and he has not forgotten nor forgiven himself over their deaths.  In many ways he feels unworthy to experience happiness and love again but Skye has brought sunlight and laughter back into his life and he begins a romance that thaws his heart but also causes real turmoil.  He finds himself torn between honor and love.Nicole Jordan writes beautiful prose and her characters are fully developed.  I liked everyone in this novel including Skye&#8217;s uncle and her aunt.

I've always been fond of the era with its iconic fashion and there are fewer times in history that seem as fun to drop a paranormal plot in than one already plagued by prohibition. Enter one of the very small handful of authors I pre-order without reading blurbs for, the sharp and sagacious Jenn Bennett.While the blurb for BITTER SPIRITS does a very wonderful job of presenting the basics of what you'll be reading I realized right away that as a reader of her urban fantasy series first I was mildly disappointed. I'm just so used to her voice without the romance as the central plot that it felt slow to take off. Once it did though, I struggled to put it down. A thorough researcher and quite impressively able to blend unexpected things together, Bennett made the odd mix of Chinese and Swedish characters and cultures truly immersive. I hated to be pulled away to scenes with just Aida and Winter&#8212;and mercy do they have chemistry!&#8212;simply because I was so invested in the world.When I was able to let go of the plethora of unique and enjoyable secondary characters long enough I really enjoyed the romance itself. Aida and Winter are a great couple, the sort you root for from the instant they meet. They're both a bit wounded and plagued by things they're not ready to tell one another which keeps them from falling in love too quickly. When they come together intimately it's scorching but not gratuitous, something I very much appreciated considering the era.By the time I finished BITTER SPIRITS I had run a gamut of emotions, become very fond of some secondary characters I hope get their own romantic tales later in the series, and decided I had to pre-order GRIM SHADOWS. It's not as thick on the paranormal elements as I'd love&#8212;what can I say? I'm addicted to monsters&#8212;but it's a ferocious romp with ghostly elements I think both paranormal romance readers and historical romance readers should give a taste.Notes: ARC received via author.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Speakeasy Spirits & All That Jazz", "unixReviewTime": 1389052800, "reviewTime": "01 7, 2014"}

One to Protect continues the path to their happily ever after; a baby, a marriage, and the life Derek and Melissa have always wanted are in their grasp, but one person stands in their way &#8211; Sloan, Melissa&#8217;s ex-husband. No matter how hard Derek has fought to put Sloan away and end Melissa&#8217;s nightmare once and for all, the job can never get done because the slime ball always seems to slither away from his judgment day. But when Derek receives information that once again threatens his life with Melissa, he teams up with Patrick and an unlikely ally to end Sloan&#8217;s torment once and for all.The story is told from both Derek and Melissa&#8217;s point of views, which is the best way to tell it because as Derek&#8217;s mission to end Sloan&#8217;s control over their lives commences, Derek and Mel find themselves apart for quite a bit of the text. Readers need to understand what both of them are thinking and feeling as everything goes down, and we get that with the dual perspective.Derek is still the dominant alpha male who takes care of what&#8217;s his and every move he makes is focused on that. His love for Melissa drives him; it makes him better, and he&#8217;ll ensure that it remains that way. There is nothing weak about Melissa. She&#8217;s a fighter who had to overcome tremendous obstacles, which she did, and even though fear threatens to consume her yet again, she refuses to back down; she&#8217;ll protect Derek as much as he&#8217;s protecting her.The One to Hold Series is a fantastic journey about four dynamic characters. Even though the focus of One to Protect is on Derek and Mel&#8217;s continuing journey, Patrick and Elaine are just as important to the dynamics of the story. The way they have each other&#8217;s back is phenomenal, and the obstacles with Sloane could not have been sorted without Patrick&#8217;s quick thinking and backbone.Tia Louise&#8217;s stories are sexy, drama filled adventures that do not disappoint. They revolve around dynamic characters who hold nothing back in life and in love. The One to Hold Series is a must read for anyone who loves romance mixed with action and angst. I can&#8217;t wait for One to Love!A complimentary copy of the book was provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.4 poison apples (The Fairest of All Book Reviews)", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A fantastic continuation of Derek and Melissa's story", "unixReviewTime": 1397952000, "reviewTime": "04 20, 2014"}

The book is a blend of dark and urban fantasy that was well written and captivating. The characters were original and the mix of supernaturals was wonderful. I also love urban fantasies because they aren't afraid to throw in the whole melting pot of supers and this one didn't disappoint. The story flowed perfectly and kept me from wanting to put it down. The plot was the right mix of action, fantasy, darkness and the subtle romance in the right places. I had no problems envisioning the world as the details were well done and spot on. The tension in the plot was wonderfully mastered  right up until the end....darn end (spoiler). The strongest element in this book was the story itself - the details were thought out and the storyline masterfully executed. I can't wait to see what we come up against in the next installment.Characters: Natalya- Natalya is a fun heroine and perfectly fit for her job and the world she's in. She's a touch on the cliche side as this character (the type not Natalya) has become very popular. However that doesn't stop her from being well written. She's sassy, sarcastic and kick butt. She's been looking out for herself and does it properly but she has no issues falling in line with her partner or protecting others. I also enjoyed that she was a tiger shifter as it gave her a little something extra.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "great book 1", "unixReviewTime": 1399593600, "reviewTime": "05 9, 2014"}

My wife thought it was a weird story and couldn't get past the training regimen that occurred throughout the story with Ender and the other kids.  I thought the ages of the kids was hard to get past until you started to see them as genius-level soldiers and especially with Ender, a level of maturity not usually seen in adults.  I was reminded of the training programs that the female gymnasts go through to prepare for the Olympics.  Most of them are young teens with exceptional athletic talents.  When you see how merciless the coaches are and how dedicated the athletes become you get a sense of what Ender faces.  Except that it's the survival of the human race that is at stake here not just a gold medal.  It was interesting to see how this story played out.  Since the reader had a little more information than Ender, you could anticipate some of the things that were going to happen to him throughout his training, at least until the end.  The climax of the story actually seemed kind of stale because Ender didn't seem to care by then what happens.  I know that this was only intended to be a 1st of four books, so you couldn't have a big ending because the story must go on.  I think that anyone who has had to go through intensive training for the military or for athletics can relate to this story.  It isn't exactly suspenseful or vividly descriptive science fiction but the story builds and the characters grow.  I liked it enough to decide to read the sequels so I would recommend this book too.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Interesting Sci-Fi Story", "unixReviewTime": 1398211200, "reviewTime": "04 23, 2014"}
